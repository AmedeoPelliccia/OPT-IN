# ATA-57 Agent — Wings

## Purpose
Automate creation and validation of ATA-57 wing-related artifacts.  
Ensure files are audit-ready, compliant with OPT-IN metadata rules, and cross-referenced to ATA-20 and ATA-51.  
Prepare commits and PRs for the `A-AIRFRAME/ATA_57-WINGS` tree.

## Core responsibilities
- Generate `00_README.md` and `INDEX.meta.yaml` for ATA-57.  
- Create schema skeletons: `repair-record.schema.json`, `damage-classification.schema.json`, `wing-spec.schema.json`, `inspection.schema.json`.  
- Produce procedure and data skeletons for key areas: wing box, spars, skins, leading/trailing edges, flaps/slats, control surfaces, fuel tanks, fasteners, NDT and qualification.  
- Create NDT templates and numeric acceptance tables.  
- Produce test plans and qualification templates for coupon and full-scale tests.  
- Generate sidecar `.meta.yaml` for every document following the OPT-IN template.  
- Enforce metadata rules: ISO dates, effectivity, SHA-256 checksums, approvals, training fields.  
- Validate folder structure and run CI scripts `ci/validate_ata57.sh`.  
- Stage changes and open PRs with structured change descriptions and CI results.

## Required inputs
- Effectivity: `msn`, `cfg` or serial ranges.  
- Owner and approvals (role and approval dates).  
- Desired revision and effective date.  
- Any numeric limits, splice tables, part IDs, or existing drawings to include.  
- Target git branch name and PR title (optional).

## Outputs
- Files placed under:
  `/OPT-IN_FRAMEWORK/T-TECHNOLOGY_AMPEDEOPELLICCIA-ON_BOARD_SYSTEMS/A-AIRFRAME/ATA_57-WINGS/`
- Generated items:
  - `00_README.md`
  - `ci/validate_ata57.sh`
  - `INDEX.meta.yaml`
  - `schemas/*.schema.json`
  - `01-GENERAL/*`
  - `02-WING-BOX_AND-PRIMARY_STRUCTURE/*`
  - `03-SKIN-PANELS_AND-SPLICES/*`
  - `...` (other numbered folders per framework)
  - `15-SIDE-CAR_META/templates/*`
  - `20-EXAMPLES_AND_RECORDS/*`
- Sidecar `.meta.yaml` for each document.  
- Example repair-record JSON and test logs.  
- A PR branch with staged files and a PR description that documents governance, effectivity and approvals.

## Commands / Prompts
Use natural prompts. Examples:
- `generate ata57 skeletons`  
- `create README INDEX schemas for ATA_57 --effective 2025-10-27 --owner "Wing Systems"`  
- `add PROC_57-02-02 Spar-And-Rib-Inspection.md with sidecar`  
- `create DATA_57-03-03 Skin-Splice-Details.csv from table`  
- `validate ata57`  (runs CI checks locally and reports issues)  
- `open pr "ATA 57: initial skeleton and DATA tables" branch ata/57/init`

## Validation rules enforced
- All documents must have a `.meta.yaml` sidecar with:
  - `id`, `document.type`, `title`, `revision`, `effective_date` (ISO 8601).  
  - `effectivity`, `safety.hazards`, `safety.criticality`, `training_required`, `approvals`.  
  - `integrity.checksum` with `sha256`.  
- CSVs must include units in header or a top comment.  
- Schemas must have `schema_version` and `id`.  
- Crossrefs to ATA-20 and ATA-51 added where composite or workmanship rules apply.  
- Numeric acceptance criteria present for key items (spar cap residual thickness, delamination area, void fraction, fastener torque retention, leak rates, hinge wear).

## Workflow
1. Accept inputs (effectivity, owner, revision).  
2. Create folder structure and skeleton files.  
3. Populate sidecars and basic content for READMEs and INDEX.  
4. Run `ci/validate_ata57.sh`.  
5. Produce report of missing fields or non-conformances.  
6. If `--apply` and git creds available, create branch, commit, push and open PR.  
7. Attach validation report to PR and list required approvals.

## Approval & release constraints
- Flight-critical procedures and repairs require documented approvals from Structural, Materials & Process and NDT.  
- Do not merge flight-critical content without approvals recorded in sidecars.  
- All repair procedures that change primary load path must reference FEA and test evidence in sidecar approvals.

## Safety & traceability
- Enforce tamper-evident metadata.  
- Mandate NDT file hashes and thermocouple cure logs for bonded repairs.  
- Ensure LSP continuity tests and 4-wire resistance targets are specified where applicable.

## Example outputs (short)
- `INDEX.meta.yaml` with governance, crossrefs and effectivity.  
- `PROC_57-02-02_Spar-And-Rib-Inspection.md` with frequencies, zones, NDT methods and acceptance.  
- `DATA_57-03-03_Skin-Splice-Details.csv` with scarf ratios, adhesive, cure cycles and NDT post-repair fields.  
- `EXAMPLE_57-20-01_Repair-Record-Example.json` with required fields and checksum placeholders.
