# Unique W&B Challenges
ampel360_specific_challenges:
  - "BWB loading extremely sensitive to CG position"
  - "Multiple consumables: SAF, LH₂, captured CO₂"
  - "In-flight CG shift as fuels consumed and CO₂ stored"
  - "FMS active CG calculation required"
  - "Cryogenic H₂ density changes with temperature"

notes: |
  BWB CG envelope is more restrictive than traditional aircraft.
  Real-time FMS monitoring of CG during flight is mandatory.
  Loading charts account for unique BWB passenger/cargo distribution.
