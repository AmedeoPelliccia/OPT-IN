# Notes
notes: |
  Hydrogen leak procedures are unique to AMPEL360 and represent a novel emergency
  scenario in commercial aviation. This procedure is based on:
  - Extensive hazard analysis and fault tree analysis
  - Hydrogen safety protocols from aerospace and industrial applications
  - Multiple layers of automatic protection (sensors, isolation valves)
  - Flight test validation of leak detection and isolation systems
  
  Key safety features:
  - Multiple redundant H₂ sensors (25% LEL trigger threshold)
  - Automatic isolation at sensor trigger
  - Hydrogen naturally vents upward (lighter than air)
  - Multiple barriers between H₂ system and ignition sources
  - Battery system provides backup power for safe landing
  
  Flight crew must understand hydrogen properties:
  - Colorless, odorless - detection by sensors only
  - Wide explosive range (4-75% in air)
  - Extremely cold (-253°C) in liquid form
  - Rapid dispersion due to low density
