# Notes
notes: |
  Area monitoring is critical safety barrier for H₂ refueling operations.
  Continuous monitoring required - no interruption permitted during refueling.
  Multiple sensors provide redundancy and coverage.
  Alarm response procedures must be practiced regularly.
  
  H₂ detection at 25% LEL provides safety margin before 100% LEL (4% in air).
  O₂ monitoring prevents asphyxiation from H₂ or inert gas displacement.
  
  Weather conditions affect sensor placement and H₂ dispersion.
  Regular calibration mandatory to ensure sensor accuracy.
  
  Footer cross-reference to GSE manuals ensures integrated safety approach.
