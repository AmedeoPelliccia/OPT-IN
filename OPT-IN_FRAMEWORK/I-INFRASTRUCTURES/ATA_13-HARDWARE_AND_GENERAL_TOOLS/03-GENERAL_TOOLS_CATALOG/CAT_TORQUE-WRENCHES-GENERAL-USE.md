## Operating Procedures

### Pre-Use Inspection
1. Verify calibration sticker is current (not expired)
2. Check for visible damage (bent handle, cracked housing)
3. Inspect drive end for wear or damage
4. Test operation through full range (click-type should "click" smoothly)
5. Verify proper torque units are selected
6. For digital wrenches, check battery level

### Torque Application Procedure
1. **Select Proper Wrench:** Use selection guide above
2. **Set Torque Value:** 
   - Click-type: Adjust scale to desired torque
   - Digital: Program target torque
3. **Install Socket/Adapter:** Ensure secure engagement
4. **Apply Torque:**
   - Hold wrench by handle only
   - Apply smooth, steady pull (do not jerk)
   - Apply force perpendicular to wrench handle
   - Stop immediately when click occurs (click-type) or alert sounds (digital)
5. **Verify:** For critical fasteners, verify with second pull
6. **Document:** Record torque value per maintenance procedure

### Post-Use Procedures
1. Return wrench to lowest setting (click-type only)
2. Clean wrench with approved cleaner (do not immerse in solvent)
3. Return to storage case
4. Document usage (cycle counter for calibration tracking)
5. Report any damage or suspected calibration issues immediately

## Calibration Requirements

### Calibration Frequency
- **Click-Type:** Every 6 months OR 2,000 cycles, whichever occurs first
- **Beam-Type:** Annually
- **Digital:** Every 6 months
- **Torque Multipliers:** Annually
- **After suspected over-torque event:** Immediate calibration required

### Calibration Method
- Performed by certified calibration laboratory
- Traceable to NIST standards
- 5-point calibration (20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% of range)
- Accuracy must meet manufacturer specification (typically ±3-4%)
- Calibration certificate provided with each calibration
- Calibration sticker affixed with next due date

### Out-of-Tolerance
- Wrench tagged "OUT OF SERVICE"
- Remove from service immediately
- Return to calibration lab for adjustment or repair
- Investigate any fasteners torqued with out-of-tolerance wrench

**Refer to:** `/calibration/schedule.csv`

## Common Errors and Prevention

| Error | Consequence | Prevention |
| :---- | :---------- | :--------- |
| Using wrench outside calibrated range | Inaccurate torque | Select proper wrench per selection guide |
| Not returning to lowest setting (click-type) | Premature wear, loss of accuracy | Always return to lowest setting after use |
| Side loading or bending wrench | Damage, inaccurate torque | Apply force perpendicular to handle |
| Continuing past "click" | Over-torque | Stop immediately at click |
| Using extensions or adapters | Torque value changes | Use torque calculation for extensions |
| Not checking calibration | Safety risk | Check calibration sticker before each use |
| Using as breaker bar | Damage | Use breaker bar for removal; torque wrench for installation only |

---

## Torque Calculation with Extensions

When using extension on torque wrench, calculated torque differs from applied torque:

**Formula:** T_actual = T_wrench × (L_wrench / (L_wrench + L_extension))

Where:
- T_actual = Actual torque applied to fastener
- T_wrench = Torque reading on wrench
- L_wrench = Length of torque wrench (from drive to handle center)
- L_extension = Length of extension

**Example:** 
- Wrench length = 15"
- Extension length = 5"
- Target torque = 100 ft-lbs

Required wrench setting = 100 × (20 / 15) = 133 ft-lbs

**Note:** This applies to extensions perpendicular to wrench. Parallel extensions do not affect torque.

---

## Storage Requirements

- Store in protective case when not in use
- Store click-type wrenches at lowest torque setting
- Store in climate-controlled environment (40-90°F)
- Keep away from corrosive materials and moisture
- Do not stack heavy items on cases
- Store vertically or horizontally (do not lean against wall)
