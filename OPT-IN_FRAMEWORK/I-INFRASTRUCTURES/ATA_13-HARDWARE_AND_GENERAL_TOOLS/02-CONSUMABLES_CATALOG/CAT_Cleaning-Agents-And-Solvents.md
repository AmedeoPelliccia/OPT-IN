## Application Guidelines

### Surface Preparation Sequence
1. **Gross Contamination Removal:** Use appropriate solvent or cleaner
2. **Intermediate Cleaning:** Use Stoddard solvent or IPA
3. **Final Wipe:** Use IPA, MEK, or acetone (as specified)
4. **Drying:** Allow to air dry or use clean, lint-free cloths
5. **Inspection:** Verify surface is clean and contaminant-free

### Cloth Selection

- **Shop Rags:** For general cleaning with petroleum solvents
- **Cheesecloth:** For applying cleaning agents to large surfaces
- **Tack Cloth:** For removing dust before painting

### Application Methods
- **Spray:** For hard-to-reach areas and electronics
- **Brush:** For applying cleaning agents to large surfaces
- **Immersion:** For complete part cleaning (non-electronic)
- **Ultrasonic:** For intricate parts with complex geometry
- **Wipe:** For precision surfaces and final cleaning

- Use water-based cleaners where possible
- Ensure proper ventilation when using VOC solvents
- Follow local environmental regulations for disposal

### Personal Protective Equipment
- **Solvents:** Nitrile gloves, safety glasses, ventilation
- **Alkaline Cleaners:** Chemical-resistant gloves, safety glasses, face shield for concentrated forms
- **All Cleaners:** Avoid prolonged skin contact; wash hands after use

### Waste Disposal
- Collect solvent waste in approved containers
- Do not mix different solvents
- Label waste containers clearly
- Dispose through approved hazardous waste contractor
- Contaminated rags must be stored in approved metal containers

---

## Storage Requirements

- Store flammable solvents in approved flammable storage cabinet
- Keep containers tightly sealed when not in use
- Store away from heat, sparks, and ignition sources
