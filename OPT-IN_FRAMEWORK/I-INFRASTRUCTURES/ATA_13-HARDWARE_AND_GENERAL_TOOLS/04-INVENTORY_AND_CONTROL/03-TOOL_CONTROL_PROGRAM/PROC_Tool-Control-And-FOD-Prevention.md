**Revision:** 3.0.0

---

## 1.0 Purpose

To establish a formal program for the control, issuance, and return of all tools used in aircraft maintenance to prevent Foreign Object Debris (FOD) and ensure 100% tool accountability.

---

## 2.0 Scope

This procedure applies to all personnel performing maintenance, inspection, or servicing tasks on AMPEL360 aircraft and applies to all tools, including:
- Hand tools
- Power tools (pneumatic, electric, battery-powered)

## 3.0 Definitions

**FOD (Foreign Object Debris):** Any object or substance that does not belong in or on an aircraft and could cause damage to equipment or injury to personnel.

**Tool Accountability:** A system ensuring 100% accountability for all tools issued for maintenance work.

**Shadow Board:** A tool storage system where each tool has a designated outlined location, making missing tools immediately apparent.

**Tool Crib:** Centralized secure storage facility for tools and equipment.

**Lost Tool Report (LTR):** Documentation required when a tool cannot be accounted for.
