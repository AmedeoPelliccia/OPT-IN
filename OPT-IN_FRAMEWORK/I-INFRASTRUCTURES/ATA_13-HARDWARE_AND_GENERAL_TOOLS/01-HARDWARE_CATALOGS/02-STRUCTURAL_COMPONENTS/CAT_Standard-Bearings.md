## Installation Requirements

### Rod End Bearings
1. **Thread Engagement:** Minimum 1.5 × thread diameter engagement required
2. **Lubrication:** Apply light coat of approved lubricant to bearing race before installation
3. **Torque:** Tighten jam nut to prevent loosening; do not over-tighten rod end body
4. **Inspection:** Check for smooth rotation throughout full range of motion
5. **Safety Wire:** Safety wire per ATA 20 standard practices

### Spherical Bearings
1. **Bore Preparation:** Ensure bore is clean, round, and within tolerance
2. **Press Fit:** Use arbor press with proper support; do not hammer bearing into place
3. **Alignment:** Verify bearing is seated flush and square in housing
4. **Lubrication:** Lubricate per manufacturer's recommendations (if serviceable type)

### Ball Bearings
1. **Cleanliness:** Handle with clean gloves; keep bearings in sealed packaging until installation
2. **Press Fit:** Use bearing installation tool; apply pressure to correct race only
3. **Preload:** Follow specific preload requirements for the application
4. **Lubrication:** Pre-lubricated bearings should not be cleaned or re-lubricated

---

## Inspection and Maintenance

### Visual Inspection
- Check for corrosion, pitting, or discoloration
- Inspect for cracks in housing or race
- Verify safety wire is intact (where applicable)
- Look for signs of lubrication leakage

### Functional Testing
- Rod ends: Check for smooth rotation and proper fit
- Ball bearings: Check for roughness, binding, or noise when rotated
- Spherical bearings: Verify smooth articulation throughout range

### Replacement Criteria
- Any visible damage (cracks, significant corrosion, wear)
- Excessive play or looseness in bearing
- Binding or rough operation
- Missing or damaged seals
- Contamination that cannot be cleaned

---

## Usage Notes

- **Load Ratings:** Never exceed published load ratings; apply appropriate safety factors
- **Misalignment:** Rod end bearings accommodate angular misalignment; do not use for radial loads
- **Temperature Range:** Standard bearings: -65°F to +250°F; verify for specific applications
- **Storage:** Store in original packaging in climate-controlled, low-humidity environment
- **Shelf Life:** Unlimited if properly stored and protected; inspect before use if stored >5 years
- **Substitution:** Do not substitute without engineering authorization

## Lubrication Recommendations

| Bearing Type | Lubricant | Frequency |
| :----------- | :-------- | :-------- |
| Rod End Bearings | MIL-PRF-81322 Grease | Every 100 flight hours or annually |
| Plain Spherical Bearings | MIL-PRF-81322 Grease | Every 100 flight hours or annually |
| Ball Bearings (Sealed) | Factory Pre-lubricated | No maintenance required |
| Ball Bearings (Open) | MIL-PRF-23827 Oil | Every 50 flight hours or semi-annually |
