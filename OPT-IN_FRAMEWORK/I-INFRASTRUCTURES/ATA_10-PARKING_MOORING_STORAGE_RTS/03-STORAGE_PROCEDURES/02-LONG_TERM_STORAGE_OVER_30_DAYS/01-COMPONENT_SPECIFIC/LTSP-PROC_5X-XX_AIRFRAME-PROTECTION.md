     - Wheel wells and landing gear
     - Under-belly and lower surfaces
     - Around engines and APU
     - Flap and control surface hinges
   - Rinse thoroughly with clean water

2. **Drying**
   - Forced air dry all surfaces
   - **Critical**: Remove water from:
     - Lap joints and seams
     - Drain holes and vents
     - Control surface hinges
     - Door and window seals
   - Verify no standing water anywhere

3. **Inspection During Cleaning**
   - Note any paint damage, corrosion, or cracks
   - Document findings
   - Repair before storage if possible

### 4.2 Corrosion Treatment

**Areas requiring special attention:**
- Battery compartments
- Areas near lavatories (moisture)
- Wheel wells
- Belly skin near drain masts
- Electrical connector areas

**Treatment:**
1. Clean area thoroughly
2. Remove any corrosion (light sanding, chemical treatment)
3. Apply corrosion inhibitor (LPS-3, ACF-50, or approved)
4. Touch up paint if needed
5. Apply additional protective coating

## 5. PAINT PROTECTION

### 5.1 Paint Inspection and Repair

**Inspect all painted surfaces for:**
- Chips, scratches, or missing paint
- Fading or chalking

**Repair Procedure:**
1. Clean area
2. Remove loose or damaged paint
3. Treat bare metal (primer)
4. Touch up with matching paint
5. Apply clear protective coat if available

### 5.2 Paint Protection Application

**For storage > 90 days:**
1. Apply aircraft wax to all painted surfaces
   - Use approved aviation-grade wax
   - Hand buff to uniform finish
   - Provides UV protection and moisture barrier
2. Apply additional protective coating to high-wear areas:
   - Leading edges
   - Walking surfaces
   - Around doors and hatches
