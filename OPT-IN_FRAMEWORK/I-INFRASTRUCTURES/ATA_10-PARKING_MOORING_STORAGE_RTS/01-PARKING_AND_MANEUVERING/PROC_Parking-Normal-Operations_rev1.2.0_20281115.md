## 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes the standard parking operations for the AMPEL360 aircraft under normal conditions.

## 2. Scope

Applies to all routine parking operations at gates, ramps, and designated parking areas for AMPEL360 aircraft.

## 3. Prerequisites

- Aircraft main engines shut down
- APU available (if required for ground power)
- Parking brake set
- Ground crew in position
- Marshaller signals acknowledged

## 4. Safety Precautions

- ⚠️ Ensure all personnel are clear of engine intake and exhaust areas
- ⚠️ Verify parking brake engagement before crew disembarkation
- ⚠️ Maintain minimum clearance distances from adjacent aircraft and structures
- ⚠️ Monitor for fuel/fluid leaks during and after parking

## 5. Equipment Required

- Parking chocks (minimum 4, rated for aircraft weight)
- Safety cones and barriers
- Ground power unit (if required)
- Fire extinguisher (within reach)

## 6. Procedure

### 6.1 Pre-Parking Checks

1. Verify parking area is clear of obstacles and debris
2. Confirm adequate clearance for wingtips and tail
3. Check surface condition (no ice, standing water, or damage)
4. Position ground crew and equipment

### 6.2 Parking Sequence

1. **Approach**
   - Follow marshaller signals
   - Maintain slow taxi speed (< 5 knots)
   - Monitor wingtip clearances continuously

2. **Final Positioning**
   - Align aircraft centerline with parking spot markings
   - Verify nose gear on centerline
   - Confirm clearance on both sides

3. **Stop and Secure**
   - Apply parking brake firmly
   - Verify "PARK BRAKE ON" indication
   - Announce "PARKING BRAKE SET" to ground crew

4. **Chocking**
   - Install forward and aft chocks on main gear wheels
   - Verify chocks are properly seated
   - Confirm chocks are rated for aircraft weight

### 6.3 Post-Parking Actions

1. Complete parking checklist in aircraft documentation
2. Install safety barriers/cones around aircraft
3. Connect ground power if required
4. Record parking time and location

## 7. Special Considerations for BWB Configuration

- Allow additional clearance for wide body configuration
- Monitor ground crew positioning due to limited visibility from cockpit
- Verify adequate clearance for passenger boarding bridges
- Check for interference with adjacent gates/parking spots

## 8. Normal Parking Clearances

| Parameter | Minimum Clearance |
|-----------|------------------|
| Wingtip to object | 3.0 m (10 ft) |
| Tail to object | 2.5 m (8 ft) |
| Nose to object | 3.0 m (10 ft) |
| Main gear to marking | ±0.5 m (±1.6 ft) |

## 9. Completion Criteria

- ✅ Aircraft on centerline within tolerance
- ✅ Parking brake set and verified
- ✅ All wheels chocked
- ✅ Safety barriers in place
- ✅ Documentation completed
