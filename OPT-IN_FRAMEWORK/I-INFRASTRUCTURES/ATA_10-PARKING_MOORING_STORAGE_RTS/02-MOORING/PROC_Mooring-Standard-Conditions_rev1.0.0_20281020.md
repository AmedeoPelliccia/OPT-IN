**Document ID**: PROC_Mooring-Standard-Conditions  
**Revision**: 1.0.0  
**Date**: 2028-10-20  
**ATA Chapter**: 10  
**Subsection**: 02 - MOORING

---

## 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes mooring requirements for AMPEL360 aircraft under standard weather conditions.

## 2. Scope

Applies to outdoor parking areas where aircraft must be secured against wind and weather. Standard conditions defined as sustained winds ≤ 35 knots with gusts ≤ 45 knots.

## 3. Prerequisites

- Aircraft properly parked and chocked
- Mooring equipment inspected and serviceable
- Weather forecast reviewed (next 24 hours minimum)
- Ground crew qualified in mooring operations

## 4. Safety Precautions

- ⚠️ Ensure proper tension on all tie-down ropes/straps
- ⚠️ Verify anchor points rated for expected loads
- ⚠️ Monitor weather conditions continuously
- ⚠️ Upgrade to high-wind mooring if conditions warrant
- ⚠️ Keep personnel clear of tensioned tie-downs

## 5. Equipment Required

### Mooring Ropes/Straps
- Minimum breaking strength: 15,000 lbs (67 kN)
- 6-8 tie-downs (depending on aircraft configuration)
- Chafe protection sleeves
- Tensioning devices

### Anchor Points
- Ground anchors rated ≥ 20,000 lbs (89 kN)
- Anchor spacing per DIAG_Mooring-Tie-Down-Points-BWB.dxf
- Anchor inspection current (< 90 days)

### Inspection Equipment
- Tension gauge
- Measuring tape
- Flashlight for night operations
- Documentation forms

## 6. Mooring Points - AMPEL360 BWB

Refer to DIAG_Mooring-Tie-Down-Points-BWB.dxf for exact locations.

| Tie-Down # | Location | Max Load | Notes |
|------------|----------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Nose gear strut | 10,000 lbs | Forward restraint |
| 2 | Left forward wing | 15,000 lbs | 45° angle |
| 3 | Right forward wing | 15,000 lbs | 45° angle |
| 4 | Left aft body | 15,000 lbs | Lateral restraint |
| 5 | Right aft body | 15,000 lbs | Lateral restraint |
| 6 | Tail/empennage | 12,000 lbs | Aft restraint |

Optional (high crosswind):
| 7 | Left mid-body | 15,000 lbs | Additional lateral |
| 8 | Right mid-body | 15,000 lbs | Additional lateral |

## 7. Procedure

### 7.1 Pre-Mooring Inspection

1. **Aircraft Inspection**
   - Verify parking brake set
   - Check wheel chocks installed (all main gear wheels)
   - Inspect mooring attach points for damage
   - Ensure control surfaces in neutral/locked position

2. **Anchor Point Verification**
   - Confirm anchor locations match aircraft position
   - Verify anchors secure and undamaged
   - Check anchor inspection tags current
   - Measure distances to ensure proper angles

### 7.2 Mooring Installation

1. **Sequence** (install in order listed)
   - Nose tie-down (prevent forward movement)
   - Left forward wing
   - Right forward wing
   - Left aft body
   - Right aft body
   - Tail tie-down

2. **Attachment Technique**
   - Route rope/strap through aircraft attach point
   - Secure to ground anchor with approved knot/fastener
   - Install chafe protection at all contact points
   - Apply initial tension (hand-tight)

3. **Tensioning**
   - Tension all tie-downs evenly
   - Target tension: 500-800 lbs per tie-down
   - Use tension gauge to verify
   - Re-check all tie-downs after initial tensioning
   - Document tension readings

### 7.3 Final Inspection

1. **Visual Check**
   - All tie-downs properly routed (no sharp bends)
   - Chafe protection in place
   - No interference with aircraft systems
   - Adequate slack for thermal expansion/contraction

2. **Documentation**
   - Complete mooring checklist
   - Record weather conditions at time of mooring
   - Note any deviations or special circumstances
   - Photograph setup (recommended)

### 7.4 Mooring Placard

Install placard in cockpit and on exterior:
```
AIRCRAFT MOORED
Tie-downs: [number]
Date: [date/time]
Expected wind: [forecast]
Contact: [phone number]
```

## 8. Standard Mooring Configuration - Angles

All tie-downs should form approximately 45° angle to ground:
- Horizontal distance from anchor to aircraft: 0.7 × height of attach point
- Prevents excessive vertical or horizontal loads
- Optimizes load distribution

## 9. Inspection Schedule

| Frequency | Actions |
|-----------|---------|
| Every 4 hours | Visual inspection of all tie-downs |
| Every 12 hours | Re-tension and document |
| After weather event | Full inspection and re-tension |
| Before forecast change | Evaluate upgrade to high-wind mooring |

## 10. Removal Procedure

1. Verify aircraft release authorized
2. Remove tie-downs in reverse order of installation
3. Inspect attach points for damage
4. Coil and stow mooring equipment
5. Remove placards
6. Document removal time and aircraft condition

## 11. When to Upgrade to High-Wind Mooring

Transition to PROC_Mooring-High-Wind-BWB if:
- Sustained winds forecast > 35 knots
- Gusts forecast > 45 knots  
- Severe weather warning issued
- Extended exposure period (> 48 hours)
- Aircraft particularly exposed to wind

## 12. Completion Criteria

- ✅ All required tie-downs installed and tensioned
- ✅ Chafe protection in place
- ✅ Placard installed
- ✅ Documentation completed
- ✅ Inspection schedule established
