**Document ID**: PROC_Mooring-High-Wind-BWB  
**Revision**: 1.3.0  
**Date**: 2028-11-05  
**ATA Chapter**: 10  
**Subsection**: 02 - MOORING

## 1. Purpose

This procedure establishes enhanced mooring requirements for AMPEL360 BWB aircraft during high-wind conditions (sustained winds > 35 knots or gusts > 45 knots).

## 2. Scope

Applies when aircraft must remain secured outdoors during high-wind conditions. The BWB configuration presents unique aerodynamic characteristics requiring additional tie-down points.

## 3. BWB High-Wind Considerations

The Blended Wing Body design features:
- **Large lifting surface area** - Entire body generates lift, increasing wind loads
- **Low profile** - Greater susceptibility to crosswinds
- **Wide footprint** - Requires distributed tie-down pattern
- **Unique load paths** - Tie-down forces distributed differently than conventional aircraft

## 4. Prerequisites

- Standard mooring already installed OR aircraft ready for initial mooring
- High-wind mooring equipment available and inspected
- Additional ground crew (minimum 4 personnel)
- Weather monitoring capability
- Structural engineering approval for tie-down loads

## 5. Safety Precautions

- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: BWB can generate significant lift even when parked
- ⚠️ Monitor all tie-downs continuously during high-wind events
- ⚠️ Do not personnel near aircraft during extreme gusts
- ⚠️ Additional tie-downs may reach 90% of rated capacity
- ⚠️ Evacuate area if any tie-down shows signs of failure
- ⚠️ Consider hangaring aircraft if winds forecast > 65 knots

## 6. Equipment Required

### Enhanced Mooring Kit (BWB High-Wind)
- 12 tie-down straps (minimum breaking strength: 20,000 lbs / 89 kN)
- Heavy-duty chafe protection
- Load-rated shackles and tensioners
- Additional ground anchors (installed or mobile)
- Continuous tension monitoring devices (recommended)

### Support Equipment
- Pitot/static port covers (installed)
- Engine inlet/exhaust covers (installed)
- Door seals verified (prevent pressurization)
- Control surface locks (if available)

## 7. High-Wind Mooring Points

Refer to DIAG_Mooring-Tie-Down-Points-BWB.dxf for locations.

### Primary Tie-Downs (Always Required)
| TD # | Location | Max Load | Angle | Purpose |
|------|----------|----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Nose gear | 12,000 lbs | 45° | Forward restraint |
| 2 | LH forward wing root | 18,000 lbs | 45° | Lift restraint |
| 3 | RH forward wing root | 18,000 lbs | 45° | Lift restraint |
| 4 | LH mid-body | 18,000 lbs | 60° | Lateral/lift |
| 5 | RH mid-body | 18,000 lbs | 60° | Lateral/lift |
| 6 | LH aft body | 18,000 lbs | 45° | Aft lateral |
| 7 | RH aft body | 18,000 lbs | 45° | Aft lateral |
| 8 | Tail/aft fuselage | 15,000 lbs | 45° | Aft restraint |

### Additional Tie-Downs (Winds > 50 knots)
| TD # | Location | Max Load | Notes |
|------|----------|----------|-------|
| 9 | LH wing tip | 12,000 lbs | Prevents wing lift |
| 10 | RH wing tip | 12,000 lbs | Prevents wing lift |
| 11 | LH outboard body | 15,000 lbs | Additional lateral |
| 12 | RH outboard body | 15,000 lbs | Additional lateral |

## 8. Procedure

### 8.1 Pre-Mooring Configuration

1. **Aircraft Preparation**
   - Set parking brake and verify
   - Install control surface locks (if equipped)
   - Install pitot/static covers
   - Install engine covers
   - Close and lock all doors/hatches
   - Ensure fuel load balanced (no wing-heavy condition)

2. **Equipment Staging**
   - Position all mooring equipment
   - Verify anchor points installed
   - Test tensioning devices
   - Assign crews to specific tie-down stations

### 8.2 Installation Sequence

**Phase 1: Primary Restraint (TD 1-4)**
1. Install nose tie-down (#1) - prevents forward movement
2. Install LH forward wing root (#2) - critical lift restraint
3. Install RH forward wing root (#3) - critical lift restraint
4. Install LH mid-body (#4) - primary lateral

**Phase 2: Aft Stabilization (TD 5-8)**
5. Install RH mid-body (#5) - balances lateral loads
6. Install LH aft body (#6) - aft lateral stability
7. Install RH aft body (#7) - aft lateral stability
8. Install tail tie-down (#8) - prevents aft movement

**Phase 3: Enhanced Restraint (TD 9-12, if required)**
9. Install wingtip tie-downs (#9, #10) - prevents wingtip lift
10. Install outboard body tie-downs (#11, #12) - additional lateral stability

### 8.3 Tensioning Protocol

1. **Initial Tensioning (All Tie-Downs)**
   - Apply tension sequentially in installation order
   - Target: 800-1,200 lbs per tie-down initially
   - Use calibrated tension gauge
   - Document all readings

2. **Load Balancing**
   - Verify symmetrical tension (LH vs RH within 10%)
   - Adjust as needed to balance loads
   - Ensure no single tie-down > 80% rated capacity
   - Re-check all after balancing

3. **Final Tensioning**
   - All primary tie-downs: 1,000-1,500 lbs
   - Wing tip tie-downs: 800-1,000 lbs
   - Document final tensions
   - Mark "OK" on each tie-down

### 8.4 BWB-Specific Checks

1. **Lift Prevention**
   - Verify wing root tie-downs preventing upward movement
   - Check body tie-downs resist rolling moment
   - Confirm symmetrical loading

2. **Load Path Verification**
   - All tie-downs route through approved attach points
   - No loads applied to thin skin sections
   - Chafe protection at all contact points
   - No interference with aerodynamic surfaces

3. **Documentation**
   - Complete high-wind mooring checklist
   - Photograph all tie-down points
   - Record weather conditions
   - Note aircraft weight and fuel load

### 8.5 Monitoring and Inspection

| Frequency | Actions |
|-----------|---------|
| Every 2 hours | Visual inspection all tie-downs |
| Every 4 hours | Measure and document tensions |
| After gusts > 50 kt | Full inspection and re-tension |
| Continuous | Weather monitoring |

**Continuous Monitoring** (if winds > 55 knots):
- Assign personnel to maintain visual watch
- Radio communication with operations center
- Emergency response team on standby

## 9. Warning Signs - Immediate Action Required

If any of these observed, EVACUATE AREA and notify management:
- Any tie-down showing signs of fraying or damage
- Anchor point movement or deformation
- Unusual aircraft movement or rocking
- Tie-down tension loss (> 20% reduction)
- Structural stress sounds from aircraft

## 10. High-Wind Event Response

### During Wind Event
- No personnel near aircraft unless emergency
- Monitor remotely via cameras if available
- Document peak wind speeds and aircraft behavior
- Prepare emergency response if needed

### After Wind Event
1. Wait for winds < 35 knots before approaching
2. Full visual inspection of all tie-downs and anchors
3. Inspect aircraft for damage (focus on tie-down areas)
4. Re-tension if continuing mooring
5. Document event and any anomalies

## 11. Removal Procedure

1. Verify wind conditions acceptable (< 30 knots sustained)
2. Remove additional tie-downs first (#9-12)
3. Remove primary tie-downs in reverse order (#8 to #1)
4. Inspect all attach points for damage
5. Aircraft structural inspection before flight (if loads > 70% capacity experienced)

## 12. When to Refuse High-Wind Mooring

Do not attempt if:
- Winds forecast > 70 knots sustained
- Gusts forecast > 90 knots
- Adequate anchors not available
- Aircraft structural concerns exist
- Hangar space available as alternative

**In such cases**: Coordinate emergency hangaring or diversion.

## 13. Completion Criteria

- ✅ All required tie-downs installed per wind forecast
- ✅ All tensions within specified ranges and documented
- ✅ Load balanced symmetrically
- ✅ BWB-specific checks completed
- ✅ Monitoring schedule established
- ✅ Emergency procedures reviewed with crew
