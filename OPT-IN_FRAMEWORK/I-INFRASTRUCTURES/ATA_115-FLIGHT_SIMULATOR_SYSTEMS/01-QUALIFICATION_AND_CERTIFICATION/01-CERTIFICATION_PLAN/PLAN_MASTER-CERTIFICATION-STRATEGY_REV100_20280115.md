## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive certification strategy for achieving and maintaining EASA CS-FSTD(A) Level D qualification for the AMPEL360 Full Flight Simulator (FFS). The strategy addresses the unique challenges posed by the aircraft's innovative technologies, including Blended Wing Body (BWB) aerodynamics, cryogenic hydrogen propulsion, and quantum-inspired avionics scheduling.

## 2. Regulatory Framework

### 2.1 Primary Standards
- **EASA CS-FSTD(A)** - Certification Specifications for Aeroplane Flight Simulation Training Devices

### 2.2 Target Qualification Level
**Level D** - Highest level of flight simulator qualification, enabling:
- Zero Flight Time (ZFT) type rating training
- All phases of flight training including visual approaches
- Recurrent training and checking
- Advanced upset prevention and recovery training (UPRT)

## 3. Aircraft-Specific Certification Challenges

### 3.1 Blended Wing Body (BWB) Aerodynamics
**Challenge:** No existing BWB transport aircraft certified; limited comparative data  
**Strategy:**
- Extensive computational fluid dynamics (CFD) validation
- Wind tunnel test correlation at multiple scales
- Flight test data from AMPEL360 prototype and production aircraft
- Special emphasis on ground effect modeling (QTG Test 2.A.4b)
- Close coordination with ATA 27 Flight Control Laws team

**Cross-References:**
- ATA 27: Flight Control Laws documentation
- ATA 27: Aerodynamic manipulation systems

### 3.2 Cryogenic Hydrogen Propulsion System
**Challenge:** Novel fuel type requires new failure mode modeling  
**Strategy:**
- Detailed system modeling based on ATA 28-60 (Cryogenic H₂ Storage)
- Integration with ATA 24-60 (Fuel Cell Power Generation)
- Coordination with ATA 26-40 (H₂ Leak Detection & Fire Protection)
- Extensive procedure validation for H₂-specific emergencies
- QTG Test 3.B.2 validates fuel cell failure scenarios

**Cross-References:**
- ATA 24-60: Fuel Cell Stacks & DC Output
- ATA 26-40: H₂ Leak/Fire Detection
- ATA 28-60: Cryogenic H₂ Storage & Distribution

### 3.3 Quantum-Inspired Scheduler (QIS)
**Challenge:** Novel IMA resource management affects system behavior  
**Strategy:**
- Model QIS behavior based on ATA 42-60 specifications
- Validate task migration and resource allocation under failures
- Demonstrate proper system degradation modes
- Integration with all IMA-dependent systems

**Cross-References:**
- ATA 42-60: Quantum-Inspired Scheduler & Resource Orchestration
- ATA 42: Integrated Modular Avionics (Core Software)

## 4. Data Package Traceability

### 4.1 Aircraft Data Package (ADP) Management
All simulator data must be traceable to the official ADP:
- **Location:** `../02-AIRCRAFT_DATA_PACKAGE_OEM/`
- **Current Version:** v3.2.0
- **Version Control:** Git-based with signed commits
- **Validation:** Digital signatures required (`.sig` files)

### 4.2 Critical Data Elements
- Aerodynamic model: `01-AERO_MODEL/AERO_BWB-Flight-Model_v3.2.0.dat`
- Propulsion model: `02-PROPULSION_MODEL/PROP_Hybrid-Powertrain-Model_v3.1.5.xml`
- Avionics logic: `03-AVIONICS_LOGIC/AVNX_IMA-QIS-Interface-Spec_v2.8.0.xml`

### 4.3 Change Control Process
1. ADP updates received from aircraft OEM
2. Impact assessment on simulator fidelity
3. Simulator software/hardware modifications as required
4. Affected QTG tests re-executed
5. Authority notification and approval

## 5. Qualification Test Guide (QTG) Strategy

### 5.1 Test Development Approach
- Based on EASA CS-FSTD(A) Table of QTG Functions and Subjective Tests
- Enhanced with aircraft-specific test cases
- Each test explicitly references source data
- Tolerances derived from flight test scatter and measurement uncertainty

### 5.2 Critical Test Cases
- **Performance:** Standard throughout envelope
- **Handling:** Special focus on BWB ground effect (Test 2.A.4b)
- **Systems:** H₂ propulsion system failures (Test 3.B.2)
