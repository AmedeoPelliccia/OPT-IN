# ATA 87: Physical and Airframe Interfaces

This chapter defines the standards for physical and structural interfaces between the AMPEL360 aircraft and ground infrastructure, including gate compatibility and automated docking systems.

## Governance
* **Standard Lifecycle:** Each standard document (`-STD`) has a lifecycle state (`DRAFT`, `CANDIDATE`, `RATIFIED`, `DEPRECATED`) defined in its metadata.
* **Verifiable Compliance:** Each interface standard (ICD, PROTOCOL, SPEC) is directly linked to a compliance test procedure (`TEST_STD-89-xxx`).
* **Security by Design:** Physical specifications include exclusion zones and safety envelopes.

## Contents

### 01-GATE_COMPATIBILITY
Standards for boarding gate compatibility:
- **SPEC_STD-87-101:** Jet Bridge Interface Envelope BWB - Jet bridge interface envelope
- **SPEC_STD-87-102:** Aircraft Clearance and Exclusion Zones - Clearance and exclusion zones

### 02-AUTOMATED_DOCKING
Standards for automated docking systems:
- **PROTOCOL_STD-87-201:** Automated Guidance and Docking - Automated guidance and docking

## Cross-References
- **ATA 53:** Fuselage (aircraft structure)
- **ATA 10:** Parking, Mooring, Storage (parking procedures)
- **ATA 89:** Infrastructure Compliance and Certification (test procedures)
