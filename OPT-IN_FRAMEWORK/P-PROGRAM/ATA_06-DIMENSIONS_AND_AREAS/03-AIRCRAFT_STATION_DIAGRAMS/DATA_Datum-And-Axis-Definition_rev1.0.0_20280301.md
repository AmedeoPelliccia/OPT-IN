# Master Datum and Axis Definition
**Revision:** 1.0.0

This document establishes the master coordinate system for the AMPEL360 aircraft. All station diagrams and geometric data are referenced from this system.

- **Origin Point (0,0,0):** Defined as a theoretical point located 5.0 meters forward of the nose radome tip.
- **X-Axis (Fuselage Station - FS):** Positive (+) is forward, negative (-) is aft.
- **Y-Axis (Buttock Line - BL):** Positive (+) is to the right of the aircraft centerline when viewed from the rear.
- **Z-Axis (Water Line - WL):** Positive (+) is up. WL0 is located 2.0 meters below the main cabin floor.
- **Tolerances:** All station measurements have a tolerance of +/- 1.0 mm unless otherwise specified.
