# PROC - Servicing Power Electronics Coolant
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27  
**System:** ATA 12 - SERVICING / ATA 24 - ELECTRICAL POWER  

## Purpose
Define procedures for servicing coolant in power electronics thermal management systems.

## Scope
Applies to coolant servicing for inverters, motor controllers, and battery thermal management.

## Prerequisites
* Certified Servicing Technician
* System powered down and isolated
* Coolant specification: Propylene Glycol 50/50 mix

## Environmental Requirements
* Temperature: 10–40°C
* Humidity: ≤ 80%

## Procedure - Coolant Fill

### Step 1: Preparation
1. Verify electrical system isolated and locked out
2. Check coolant reservoir level
3. Inspect for leaks

### Step 2: Coolant Addition
1. Remove reservoir cap
2. Add coolant to full mark (typically 80 L capacity)
3. Bleed air from system per system manual
4. Verify no leaks

### Step 3: Post-Service
1. Replace cap
2. Run system self-test
3. Monitor temperature during first operation cycle
4. Record servicing event in ATA 95 DPP

## Contamination Control
* Use dedicated coolant servicing equipment marked ORANGE
* Filter coolant during transfer
* Collect sample for laboratory analysis

## Traceability
* Coolant batch ID
* Operator ID and signoff
* System temperature readings

## Records Required
* Servicing event JSON per servicing-event.schema.json

## Cross-References
* ATA 24 - Electrical power system
* ATA 95 - Digital Product Passport
