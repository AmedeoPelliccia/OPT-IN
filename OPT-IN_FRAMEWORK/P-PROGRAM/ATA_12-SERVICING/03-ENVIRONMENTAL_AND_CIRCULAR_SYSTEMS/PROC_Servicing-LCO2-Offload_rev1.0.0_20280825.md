# PROC - Servicing LCO₂ Offload
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-08-25  
**System:** ATA 12 - SERVICING / ATA 21-80-00 (Provisional)  

## Purpose
Define procedures for offloading captured liquid CO₂ from onboard carbon capture systems.

## Scope
Applies to liquid CO₂ offload operations at qualified ground stations.

## Prerequisites
* Certified Servicing Technician
* LCO₂ recovery skid available and calibrated
* System depressurized to service pressure

## Environmental Requirements
* Temperature: 10–40°C
* Wind: ≤ 15 knots
* Approved offload area with CO₂ monitoring

## Safety Precautions
* CO₂ asphyxiation hazard in confined spaces
* Pressure release hazard
* PPE: Safety glasses, gloves
* CO₂ monitor active and calibrated

## Procedure - LCO₂ Offload

### Step 1: Preparation
1. Position LCO₂ recovery skid next to aircraft
2. Verify skid capacity sufficient for offload quantity
3. Check aircraft LCO₂ quantity indicator
4. Verify system pressure (should be ≤ 10 bar)

### Step 2: System Connection
1. Connect transfer line to aircraft offload port
2. Connect vent line to approved recovery system
3. Verify all connections leak-tight
4. Open isolation valves

### Step 3: Transfer
1. Start recovery skid pump
2. Monitor transfer rate and quantity
3. Monitor system pressure (must remain < 10 bar)
4. Continue until aircraft tank empty

### Step 4: Post-Service
1. Close all valves
2. Depressurize transfer line
3. Disconnect transfer equipment
4. Replace protective caps
5. Record offload quantity in ATA 95 DPP

## Contamination Control
* Dedicated CO₂ transfer equipment
* Filter CO₂ to remove particulates
* Ensure no oil contamination in system

## Traceability
* Offload quantity (kg)
* Recovery skid ID
* Operator ID and signoff
* Destination facility for CO₂

## Records Required
* Servicing event JSON per servicing-event.schema.json
* CO₂ purity analysis if required
* Transfer quantity certification

## Cross-References
* ATA 21-80-00 - CO₂ Capture & Processing (Provisional)
* ATA 03 - GSE requirements
* ATA 95 - Digital Product Passport
