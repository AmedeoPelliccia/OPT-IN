# FIG - Servicing Panel Locations
**Revision:** 2.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-08-15  
**Format:** DXF (AutoCAD Drawing Exchange Format)  

## Description
This file contains the 3D CAD drawings showing the location of all servicing panels on the AMPEL360 BWB aircraft.

## Servicing Panel Locations

### Fuel System Panels
* SAF Refuel Port (Starboard): Station 450, WL 120
* SAF Defuel Port (Port): Station 450, WL 120
* LH₂ Fill Port (Starboard): Station 380, WL 110

**Note:** Refuel and defuel ports are intentionally positioned on opposite sides of the aircraft (Starboard vs Port) for operational safety. This configuration prevents accidental cross-connection during simultaneous refueling and defueling operations and allows for independent GSE positioning. Ground crews must be aware of this asymmetry during servicing operations.

### Hydraulic System Panels
* Hydraulic Reservoir Fill (Port): Station 520, WL 100
* Hydraulic Sample Port (Port): Station 520, WL 98

### Environmental Systems Panels
* LH₂ Purge Port (Starboard): Station 380, WL 108
* LCO₂ Offload Port (Port): Station 600, WL 115
* Power Electronics Coolant Fill (Port): Station 550, WL 105

### Water/Waste Systems Panels
* Potable Water Fill (Port): Station 700, WL 95
* Waste Drain (Port): Station 720, WL 93

## Panel Identification
All servicing panels are marked with:
* ATA chapter number
* System identifier
* Color coding per servicing medium
* QR code linking to ATA 95 DPP

## Drawing Layers
* Layer 1: Airframe outline
* Layer 2: Servicing panel locations
* Layer 3: Access doors and panels
* Layer 4: Ground clearance envelopes
* Layer 5: GSE positioning guides

## Notes
* All dimensions in millimeters
* Coordinate system: Aircraft reference frame
* Station: Longitudinal fuselage station
* WL: Water line (vertical position)
* BL: Butt line (lateral position)
