# Single Wheel Change Jacking Procedure
**Revision:** 1.1.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Document ID:** PROC_Jacking-Single-Wheel-Change_rev1.1.0_20280515

## Purpose
This procedure provides instructions for jacking a single landing gear assembly to facilitate wheel and tire changes on the AMPEL360 aircraft.

## Scope
Applicable to all AMPEL360 aircraft (MSN: ALL) requiring single wheel/tire replacement without full aircraft jacking.

## Critical Safety Warnings

⚠️ **DANGER:**
- Single-point jacking requires additional stability precautions
- Aircraft CG must be verified before lifting
- Chocks and safety devices are mandatory

## Prerequisites

### Personnel Requirements
- **Lead Technician:** 1 (certified for wheel change operations)
- **Jack Operators:** 1 minimum
- **Spotter:** 1 minimum

### Environmental Limits
- Wind speed: ≤20 knots (higher than full jacking due to lower profile)
- Temperature: -20°C to +50°C
- Level surface required (±1° maximum slope)

### Aircraft Configuration
- Fuel level: Any (CG must be calculated and within limits)
- Parking brake: Released on affected gear
- Other gears: Chocked securely

### Ground Support Equipment
- Axle jack (AP360-H005): 1 unit, calibration current
- Jack adapter for specific gear position
- Wheel chocks: 4 minimum
- Safety stands
- Floor load distribution mat (if required)

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Preparation

**Step 1.1 - Pre-Jack Assessment**
- [ ] Verify aircraft weight and CG position
- [ ] Confirm gear is serviceable (no structural damage)
- [ ] Check that replacement wheel/tire is available and inspected
- [ ] Review torque specifications for wheel installation

**Step 1.2 - Aircraft Securing**
- [ ] Apply parking brake to all gears EXCEPT the one being serviced
- [ ] Install wheel chocks on all other landing gears:
  - Main gears: 2 chocks per wheel (fore and aft)
  - Nose gear: 2 chocks (fore and aft)
- [ ] Verify aircraft is on level surface
- [ ] Install "JACKING IN PROGRESS" placards

**Step 1.3 - GSE Setup**
- [ ] Position floor mat under jack location (if required)
- [ ] Position axle jack at designated lift point
- [ ] Install correct jack adapter
- [ ] Verify jack calibration current (≤30 days)
- [ ] Position safety stand nearby for immediate deployment

### Phase 2: Jacking and Wheel Removal

**Step 2.1 - Initial Lift**
- [ ] Verify all chocks in place
- [ ] Verify all personnel clear of wheel area
- [ ] Begin jack operation slowly
- [ ] Lift until wheel is 50mm off ground
- [ ] STOP - Visual inspection

**Step 2.2 - Safety Stand Installation**
- [ ] Install safety stand under gear structure
- [ ] Adjust to just below contact
- [ ] Continue lifting additional 25mm
- [ ] Lower onto safety stand
- [ ] Verify stable support

**Step 2.3 - Wheel Removal**
- [ ] Remove wheel retaining hardware per AMM
- [ ] Extract wheel assembly
- [ ] Inspect brake assembly, bearings, and hardware
- [ ] Clean and prepare for new wheel installation

### Phase 3: Wheel Installation

**Step 3.1 - Wheel Mounting**
- [ ] Verify new wheel inspected and serviceable
- [ ] Check tire pressure per specification
- [ ] Install wheel on axle
- [ ] Install retaining hardware
- [ ] Torque to specification: ___ Nm (record actual: ___ Nm)

**Step 3.2 - Safety Verification**
- [ ] Verify all hardware properly installed
- [ ] Check wheel rotation (no binding)
- [ ] Install safety wire/cotter pins as applicable

### Phase 4: Lowering

**Step 4.1 - Preparation**
- [ ] Remove tools from work area
- [ ] Verify wheel installation complete
- [ ] Clear all personnel

**Step 4.2 - Controlled Lowering**
- [ ] Raise jack slightly to unload safety stand
- [ ] Remove safety stand
- [ ] Lower jack slowly until wheel contacts ground
- [ ] Continue lowering until full weight on wheel
- [ ] Remove jack and adapter

**Step 4.3 - Post-Maintenance Checks**
- [ ] Remove all chocks
- [ ] Verify wheel rotates freely
- [ ] Check tire pressure
- [ ] Remove "JACKING IN PROGRESS" placards
- [ ] Stow all GSE
- [ ] Complete maintenance documentation

## Quality Checkpoints

| Checkpoint | Inspector Required | Sign-off |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| CG verification | No | |
| Jack calibration current | Yes | |
| Wheel torque specification | Yes | |
| Safety wire installation | Yes | |
| Final operational check | Yes | |

## Limitations

⚠️ **CAUTION:**
- Do NOT jack aircraft if CG is outside limits for single-gear jacking
- Do NOT use single-gear jacking for prolonged maintenance (use full jacking procedure)
- Do NOT perform single-gear jacking in winds exceeding 20 knots

## Emergency Procedures

**If jack fails or aircraft becomes unstable:**
1. Do NOT attempt to move personnel under aircraft
2. If safe, lower jack immediately
3. If not safe to lower, maintain position and call for assistance
4. Evacuate all personnel from area
5. Contact Structural Engineering
