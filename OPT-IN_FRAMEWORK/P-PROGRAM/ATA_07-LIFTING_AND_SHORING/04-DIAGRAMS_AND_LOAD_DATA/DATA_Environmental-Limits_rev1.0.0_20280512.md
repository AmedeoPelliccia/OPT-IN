# Environmental Limits for Lifting and Shoring Operations
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27  
**Document ID:** DATA_Environmental-Limits_rev1.0.0_20280512

## Purpose
This document defines mandatory environmental limits for all lifting, jacking, and shoring operations on the AMPEL360 aircraft.

## Critical Safety Notice
⚠️ **WARNING:** Operations outside these limits are PROHIBITED and may result in structural damage, equipment failure, or personnel injury.

## Wind Speed Limits

### Jacking Operations (Full Aircraft)
- **Maximum Wind Speed:** 15 knots (7.7 m/s, 17.3 mph)
- **Measurement:** Sustained wind, averaged over 2 minutes
- **Measurement Height:** 2 meters above ground
- **Gusts:** Maximum gust must not exceed 20 knots
- **GO/NO-GO:** If wind exceeds 12 knots, prepare for immediate aircraft lowering

### Shoring Operations (Long-Term Storage)
- **Maximum Wind Speed:** 25 knots (12.9 m/s, 28.8 mph)
- **Measurement:** Sustained wind, averaged over 2 minutes
- **Notes:** Aircraft properly shored can withstand higher winds than jacking operations

### Component Hoisting (Engine, Battery)
- **Maximum Wind Speed:** 20 knots (10.3 m/s, 23.0 mph)
- **Measurement:** Sustained wind, averaged over 1 minute
- **Gusts:** Maximum gust must not exceed 25 knots
- **Special:** Reduce to 15 knots if hoisting over personnel areas

### Single Wheel Change
- **Maximum Wind Speed:** 20 knots (10.3 m/s, 23.0 mph)
- **Rationale:** Lower profile than full aircraft jacking, higher stability

## Temperature Limits

### All Lifting/Jacking Operations
- **Minimum Temperature:** -20°C (-4°F)
- **Maximum Temperature:** +50°C (+122°F)
- **Rationale:** 
  - Below -20°C: Hydraulic jack seals may become brittle
  - Above +50°C: Hydraulic fluid viscosity and jack performance degraded

### Special Considerations
- **Below 0°C:** 
  - Pre-warm jacks if stored in cold environment
  - Check hydraulic fluid specification for cold weather
  - Inspect seals and hoses more frequently
  - Allow jacks to stabilize 30 minutes before use
- **Above 40°C:**
  - Monitor jack pressure more frequently (expansion)
  - Protect personnel from heat stress
  - Avoid operations on asphalt surfaces (softening risk)

## Precipitation Limits

### Rain
- **Light Rain:** Operations permitted with caution
  - Ensure personnel have adequate traction
  - Protect electrical connections
  - Monitor floor surface (slipping hazard)
- **Moderate to Heavy Rain:** Operations NOT PERMITTED
  - Visibility reduced
  - Slipping hazard increased
  - Equipment may malfunction
  - Floor load distribution compromised

### Snow/Ice
- **Any Accumulation:** Operations NOT PERMITTED
  - Clear all snow/ice from work area before beginning
  - Ensure aircraft surface free of ice (load distribution)
  - De-ice jacking points and equipment
  - Monitor temperature (freeze/thaw cycles)

### Fog
- **Visibility >100 meters:** Operations permitted
- **Visibility <100 meters:** Operations NOT PERMITTED
  - Reduced visibility prevents proper monitoring
  - Communication may be compromised

## Seismic Activity

### During Operations
- **Any Seismic Alert:** STOP operations immediately
  - Lower aircraft if safe to do so
  - Evacuate personnel to safe area
  - Inspect all equipment before resuming

### Planning
- **Local Seismic Advisory Active:** Do NOT begin operations
- **History of Seismic Activity:** Consider additional shoring/bracing

## Electrical Storm Activity

### Lightning
- **Within 10 km (6 miles):** Operations NOT PERMITTED
  - Metal rigging creates lightning hazard
  - Personnel safety priority
  - Monitor weather radar
  - Wait 30 minutes after last lightning before resuming

### Thunder Heard
- **Any Thunder:** STOP outdoor operations
  - Move to indoor facility if available
  - Secure aircraft and equipment
  - Do NOT resume until 30 minutes after last thunder

## Surface Conditions

### Floor/Ground Surface
- **Slope:** Maximum 1° (1.7% grade)
  - Use shims under jacks if necessary
  - Verify aircraft attitude continuously
- **Surface Type:**
  - Concrete (good condition): Approved
  - Concrete (poor condition): Use additional mats, engineering assessment
  - Asphalt: Approved with caution, use maximum mats, avoid high temperatures
  - Gravel/unpaved: NOT PERMITTED without engineering approval
- **Contamination:**
  - Oil/grease: Must be cleaned before operations
  - Water puddles: Must be removed/drained
  - Debris: Work area must be clear

## Indoor vs Outdoor Operations

### Indoor (Preferred)
- **Advantages:**
  - Protection from weather
  - Better environmental control
  - Reduced wind effects
  - Lighting control
- **Requirements:**
  - Adequate ceiling height (minimum 15m for full aircraft jacking)
  - Adequate floor area (minimum 20m clear radius)
  - Proper ventilation
  - Fire suppression available

### Outdoor
- **Additional Requirements:**
  - Weather monitoring continuous
  - Anemometer at aircraft height
  - Quick access to shelter (for personnel)
  - Barriers to prevent unauthorized access
  - Enhanced communication system
  - Plan for rapid aircraft lowering if weather deteriorates

## Monitoring Requirements

### Mandatory Instruments

#### Wind Monitoring
- **Anemometer:** 
  - Mounted at 2m height
  - Digital display visible to Hoisting Director
  - Calibration current (annually)
  - Readings recorded every 15 minutes

#### Temperature Monitoring
- **Thermometer:**
  - Ambient temperature
  - Accuracy ±1°C
  - Readings recorded at start and every hour

#### Inclinometer/Level
- **Aircraft Attitude:**
  - Digital level, ±0.1° accuracy
  - Continuous monitoring during jacking
  - Alarm if attitude exceeds ±0.5°

### Recording Requirements
- All environmental readings must be recorded on operation checklist
- If any limit approached within 80%, increase monitoring frequency to every 5 minutes
- If any limit exceeded, document exact conditions and actions taken

\* Shoring inspections still required, but no shoring installation/removal

**CAUTION:** Operations permitted but with enhanced monitoring and preparedness for immediate shutdown

## Emergency Weather Procedures

### Deteriorating Conditions During Operations

**If wind increases above limit:**
1. Hoisting Director: Assess trend (improving or worsening)
2. If worsening: Prepare for immediate cessation
3. If aircraft jacked: Lower aircraft as rapidly as safely possible
4. If component being hoisted: Complete lift to safe position or lower to ground
5. Secure all equipment

**If storm approaching:**
1. Monitor weather radar and forecasts
2. If thunderstorm within 30 km: Begin securing operations
3. If thunderstorm within 15 km: STOP all operations
4. Lower aircraft if on jacks
5. Secure all loose equipment
6. Move personnel to shelter

**If earthquake felt:**
1. STOP all operations immediately
2. Do NOT attempt to lower jacked aircraft during shaking
3. Personnel move to open area (away from aircraft)
4. After shaking stops: Inspect all equipment before proceeding
5. If damage suspected: Engineering assessment required before resuming
