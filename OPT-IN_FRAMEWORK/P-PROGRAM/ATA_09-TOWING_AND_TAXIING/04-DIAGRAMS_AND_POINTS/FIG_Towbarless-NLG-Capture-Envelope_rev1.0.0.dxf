DXF Version: AC1024
Drawing Name: AMPEL360 Towbarless NLG Capture Envelope
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective Date: 2028-08-01

DESCRIPTION:
This DXF file defines the capture envelope for towbarless tug operations
on the AMPEL360 aircraft. It specifies the geometric limits within which
the nose landing gear must be positioned for safe capture by towbarless
tugs. Includes:
- NLG capture zone (top view and side view)
- Approach angles for towbarless tug
- Tire contact points in cradle
- Clearance envelopes for gear doors and structure

VIEWS INCLUDED:
- Top View: Plan view showing lateral capture limits
- Side View: Profile showing vertical capture limits and approach angle
- Front View: Tire position in cradle
- Detail View: Critical clearances during lift

LAYERS:
Layer 0: Nose landing gear outline (reference)
Layer 1: Capture envelope (acceptable zone for tug approach)
Layer 2: Tire positions (inflated and deflated states)
Layer 3: Tug cradle geometry (generic, based on approved tugs)
Layer 4: Clearance zones (structure, gear doors, ground)
Layer 5: Dimensions and tolerances
Layer 6: Notes and warnings

DATUM:
NLG center (axle): FS 12.5m, BL 0.0, WL variable (depends on strut extension)
Typical WL with normal strut extension: 1.2m

UNITS: Meters (m)

CAPTURE ENVELOPE DIMENSIONS:
- Lateral tolerance: ±0.15m from centerline
- Longitudinal tolerance: ±0.10m from nominal position
- Vertical (strut extension): 1.0m to 1.4m WL (normal range)
- Approach angle: 0° to 5° from aircraft centerline

CRITICAL PARAMETERS:
- Tire size: 40x14 (standard for AMPEL360)
- Tire pressure: Must be 12-16 bar (within ±5% of specification)
- Nose gear load: Maximum 60,000 kg for approved towbarless tugs
- Strut extension: Must be within normal range (not collapsed or over-extended)

APPROVED TOWBARLESS TUGS:
- Mototok Spacer 8600 (cradle width: 850mm)
- TLD NMC-1450 (cradle width: 830mm)

CLEARANCES:
- Gear door clearance during lift: Minimum 50mm
- Cradle to nose radome: Minimum 200mm
- Cradle to lower fuselage: Minimum 100mm

OPERATIONAL NOTES:
- Aircraft must be on level surface (±0.5° pitch/roll)
- NLG strut must be in normal extended position
- Tires must be properly inflated
- No ice, snow, or contamination on tires
- Verify capture envelope before lift initiation

CROSS-REFERENCES:

- ATA 08: Nose gear loading at various weights and CG
- ATA 32: NLG dimensions, tire specifications

VIEWING:
Use CAD software (AutoCAD, DraftSight, LibreCAD) to view and measure.
Recommended print scale: 1:10

WARNINGS:
⚠ Capture envelope must be verified before every towbarless tow
⚠ Improper positioning can result in:
   - Damage to NLG structure
   - Damage to gear doors
   - Tire damage
   - Unstable lift leading to aircraft tipping
⚠ If NLG is outside capture envelope, reposition aircraft before attempting capture

INSPECTION AFTER CAPTURE:
After every towbarless tow, inspect:
- Tire sidewalls for scuff marks or damage
- Wheel rims for contact marks
- Gear doors for interference marks
- NLG strut for proper extension after release
