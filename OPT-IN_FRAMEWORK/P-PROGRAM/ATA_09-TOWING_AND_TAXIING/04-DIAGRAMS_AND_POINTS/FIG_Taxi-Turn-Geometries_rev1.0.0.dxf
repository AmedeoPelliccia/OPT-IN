DXF Version: AC1024
Drawing Name: AMPEL360 Taxi Turn Geometries
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective Date: 2028-08-01

DESCRIPTION:
This DXF file contains detailed geometry data for taxi turn clearances
for the AMPEL360 aircraft. It includes:
- Wing tip sweep paths for various turn radii
- Tail clearance envelopes during turns
- Main landing gear track paths
- Critical clearance points

VIEWS INCLUDED:
- Plan View: Top-down view showing wing tip and tail paths
- Detail Views: Critical turn geometries at 15m, 25m, 50m radii
- Clearance Zones: Safety margins for various turn scenarios

LAYERS:
Layer 0: Aircraft outline (centerline position)
Layer 1: Wing tip paths (inner and outer)
Layer 2: Tail clearance envelope
Layer 3: Main gear track
Layer 4: Critical clearance dimensions
Layer 5: Notes and annotations

DATUM:
Aircraft datum point: Nose at FS 0.0, centered at BL 0.0

UNITS: Meters

CROSS-REFERENCES:
- ATA 06: Aircraft dimensions (wingspan, length, tail height)
- DATA_Wingtip-And-Tail-Clearance_Turns_rev1.0.0.csv

VIEWING:
Use CAD software (AutoCAD, DraftSight, LibreCAD) to view and measure.

NOTES:
- All clearances include 0.5m safety margin
- Turn geometries based on nose wheel steering at specified angles
- Consult with airport/ramp engineer for specific taxiway/apron layouts
