### 2. Tug and Towbar Setup

**2.1 Tug Positioning**
- Position tug in front of aircraft
- Align tug centerline with aircraft centerline
- Maintain clearance from nose radome

**2.2 Towbar Connection**
- Select towbar with correct part number for aircraft weight
- Inspect towbar for damage
- Install correct shear pin for current GW (refer to DATA_Towbar-And-Adapter-Specs)
- Connect towbar to tug drawbar
  - Verify positive locking mechanism engaged
  - Safety pin installed
- Connect towbar to aircraft NLG tow fitting
  - Clean tow fitting of debris
  - Align towbar with tow fitting
  - Engage locking mechanism
  - Verify positive lock with visual and manual check
  - Install safety devices

**2.3 Communication Setup**
- Connect ground-to-cockpit intercom OR
- Establish radio communication on designated frequency
- Perform communication check between:
  - Ground Crew Lead ↔ Brake Rider
  - Ground Crew Lead ↔ Tug Operator
  - Ground Crew Lead ↔ Wingwalkers

### 3. Final Checks Before Movement

**3.1 Ground Crew Lead Verification**
- Towbar connected and secured: aircraft and tug
- NWS pin installed and flagged
- Chocks removed from main gear
- Route clear of obstacles and personnel
- Weather within limits (record wind speed and direction)
- All personnel in position and ready
- Communication established with all positions

**3.2 Brake Rider Verification**
- Parking brake released
- Hydraulic pressure noted (if applicable)
- Ready to apply brakes if needed
- Communication with Ground Crew Lead confirmed

## Towing Operation

### 4. Initiate Tow

**4.1 Pre-Movement Communication**
- Ground Crew Lead: "Prepare to tow. Weight [X] kg, slope [Y]%, wind [Z] knots."
- Brake Rider: Acknowledge, confirm parking brake off
- Tug Operator: Acknowledge, confirm tug ready
- Wingwalkers: Acknowledge, confirm position

**4.2 Start Movement**
- Ground Crew Lead: Signal "Start Tow" to tug operator
- Tug Operator: Apply power smoothly and progressively
- Verify aircraft begins to move
- Monitor towbar alignment and loading

### 5. During Tow

**5.1 Speed Control**
- Maximum towing speed: 25 km/h on straight sections
- Reduce to 8 km/h for turns
- Adjust speed for slope, wind, and surface conditions

**5.2 Monitoring Requirements**

**Ground Crew Lead:**
- Monitor towbar for signs of overload or misalignment
- Watch for obstacles and adjust route as needed
- Monitor wingtip and tail clearances
- Maintain continuous communication

**Tug Operator:**
- Maintain steady speed and avoid sudden acceleration/braking
- Monitor tug instruments (oil pressure, temperature, DBP if equipped)
- Respond immediately to direction from Ground Crew Lead
- Stop immediately on "STOP" command

**Brake Rider:**
- Monitor hydraulic pressures
- Watch for abnormal aircraft behavior
- Ready to apply brakes in emergency
- Report any issues immediately

**Wingwalkers:**
- Monitor wingtip clearances from obstacles
- Alert Ground Crew Lead of any hazards
- Maintain visual contact with ground crew lead

**5.3 Turns**
- Reduce speed to 8 km/h before turn
- Refer to DATA_Wingtip-And-Tail-Clearance_Turns for minimum turn radii
- Verify adequate clearance before committing to turn
- Wingwalkers position for maximum visibility during turn
- Complete turn smoothly without stopping if possible

### 6. Emergency Stop Procedures

**ANY crew member may initiate emergency stop by calling "STOP"**

**Immediate Actions:**
- Tug Operator: Apply tug brakes firmly but smoothly
- Brake Rider: Apply aircraft brakes
- All Personnel: Stop all movement, remain clear of aircraft
- Ground Crew Lead: Assess situation, determine if safe to proceed

**Common Reasons for Emergency Stop:**
- Towbar failure or abnormal loading
- Obstacle in path
- Aircraft system malfunction
- Personnel safety issue
- Weather exceeding limits
- Tug mechanical issue

**Restart Criteria:**
- Cause of stop identified and resolved
- All systems verified normal
- Route re-verified clear
- Weather still within limits
- All personnel ready to continue

## Completion of Tow

### 7. Arriving at Destination

**7.1 Final Positioning**
- Align aircraft on designated parking spot
- Verify aircraft heading per parking requirements
- Stop smoothly

**7.2 Securing Aircraft**
- Brake Rider: Set parking brake

- Ensure parking brake set and chocks installed
- Disconnect towbar from aircraft tow fitting
  - Remove safety devices
  - Disengage locking mechanism
  - Carefully lower and remove towbar
- Disconnect towbar from tug
- Inspect tow fitting for damage

**8.2 Aircraft Post-Tow Configuration**
- Remove NWS pin (stow in designated location)
- Remove gear pins if installed (stow properly)
- Remove gust locks if installed
- Conduct post-tow inspection of NLG (see below)

**8.3 Post-Tow NLG Inspection**
Inspect for:
- Fluid leaks
- Cracks or deformation
- Tow fitting damage
- Tire damage
- Brake condition
- Torque link alignment

**STOP and report if any damage or abnormality observed**

### 9. Documentation
