# Towbarless Towing Procedure (ADB)
**Revision:** 1.1.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-08-01  
**Document Type:** PROC  
**Effectivity:** ALL MSN

## Purpose
This procedure defines the approved method for towing the AMPEL360 aircraft using an Aircraft Displacement Bogie (ADB) or towbarless tug that captures the nose landing gear.

## Applicability
This procedure applies to towing operations using towbarless tugs that lift and capture the nose landing gear. This method eliminates the towbar but requires specific NLG capture envelope verification.

## Advantages and Considerations

**Advantages:**
- No towbar connection/disconnection required
- Tighter turn radius possible
- Faster tow setup time
- Reduced risk of towbar-related incidents

**Considerations:**
- NLG must be within capture envelope
- Specific tug training required
- Weight on nose gear must be within tug capacity
- Tire condition critical

## Prerequisites

1. Aircraft weight and NLG loading within tug capacity
2. Towbarless tug operator qualified on type
3. Environmental conditions within limits
4. Towing route surveyed for towbarless operations
5. NLG in serviceable condition

## Environmental Limits

- **Wind:** Maximum 20 knots sustained, gusting to 25 knots
- **Crosswind Component:** Maximum 15 knots
- **Slope:** Maximum 1.5% (uphill or downhill)
- **Surface:** Dry or wet; contaminated surfaces require special approval
- **Visibility:** Minimum 400 meters

## Equipment Requirements

### Towbarless Tug Requirements
- Lift capacity adequate for nose gear load at current GW
- NLG capture cradle compatible with AMPEL360 tire size and wheel track
- Service brakes in good condition
- Lift system operational with backup
- Tow lights and communication equipment functional

### Safety Equipment
- Chocks (minimum 2 sets)
- Fire extinguisher
- Communication equipment (intercom or radio)
- High-visibility vests for all personnel
- Anemometer

## Personnel Requirements

### Minimum Crew
- Ground Crew Lead (qualified for towbarless operations)
- Brake Rider (in cockpit)
- Towbarless Tug Operator (certified on tug type)
- Wingwalkers (as required by route and local procedures)

### Additional Qualifications
- Towbarless tug operator must be certified on the specific tug model
- Ground Crew Lead must be qualified to supervise towbarless operations
- All personnel must understand NLG capture procedures

## Pre-Tow Inspection and Setup

### 1. Aircraft Preparation

**1.1 Weight Verification**
- Obtain current weight from ATA 08 documentation
- Calculate nose gear loading:
  - Refer to ATA 08 for load distribution at current CG
  - Verify nose gear load within tug lift capacity
  - Account for dynamic loading during lift

**1.2 NLG Inspection**
- Verify NLG tire pressure (critical for capture)
- Inspect tires for:
  - Proper inflation (must be within ±5% of specification)
  - Sidewall condition
  - Tread depth
  - No flat spots or damage
- Verify wheel chocks removed from nose gear area
- Check NLG strut extension (must be within normal range)

**1.3 NLG Capture Envelope Verification**
- Verify aircraft nose position allows tug approach
- Ensure NLG is within capture envelope (see FIG_Towbarless-NLG-Capture-Envelope)
- Check for obstructions:
  - Nose gear doors clear
  - No ground equipment interfering
  - Adequate clearance for tug cradle

**1.4 Systems Configuration**
- Install NWS (Nose Wheel Steering) disengage pin
- Flag pin with red streamer
- Parking brake: Released
- Hydraulic systems: Depressurized (or per specific requirements)
- Electrical: As required for brake rider

**1.5 Communication Setup**
- Establish communication between:
  - Ground Crew Lead ↔ Brake Rider
  - Ground Crew Lead ↔ Tug Operator
  - Ground Crew Lead ↔ Wingwalkers
- Perform communication check

### 2. Tug Positioning and NLG Capture

**2.1 Tug Approach**
- Ground Crew Lead: Guide tug into position
  - Align tug with aircraft centerline
  - Maintain safe clearance from nose radome
  - Position for optimal NLG capture angle

**2.2 Pre-Capture Checks**
- Ground Crew Lead: Verify:
  - Tug lift cradle clear and operational
  - NLG within capture zone
  - No personnel or equipment in pinch points
  - Brake rider ready

**2.3 NLG Capture Sequence**

*CRITICAL: The following sequence must be performed slowly and deliberately*

1. **Tug Operator:** Lower lift cradle to ground
   - Verify cradle descent smooth and controlled
   - Monitor hydraulic systems

2. **Tug Operator:** Drive tug forward slowly (max 2 km/h)
   - Ground Crew Lead: Monitor NLG entering cradle
   - Ensure tires track into cradle correctly
   - Stop when NLG centered in cradle

3. **Tug Operator:** Raise lift cradle to capture NLG
   - Lift slowly and evenly
   - Monitor nose gear compression
   - Stop when:
     - NLG fully captured in cradle
     - Weight transferred to tug
     - NLG strut compressed approximately 5-10 cm

4. **Ground Crew Lead:** Verify capture complete
   - Visual inspection: NLG secured in cradle
   - Verify weight transfer: nose gear partially unloaded but not fully lifted
   - Check: No interference with gear doors or structure
   - Confirm: Tires properly seated in cradle

**STOP IMMEDIATELY if:**
- NLG does not track properly into cradle
- Abnormal gear compression
- Any unusual noise or movement
- Cradle lift mechanism malfunction

### 3. Final Checks Before Movement

**3.1 Ground Crew Lead:**
- NLG captured and verified
- NWS pin installed and flagged
- Main gear chocks removed
- Route clear of obstacles
- Weather within limits
- All personnel in position
- Communication confirmed with all positions

**3.2 Brake Rider:**
- Parking brake released
- No abnormal indications from NLG area
- Ready to apply brakes if needed
- Communication with Ground Crew Lead confirmed

## Towing Operation

### 4. Initiate Tow

**4.1 Pre-Movement Communication**
- Ground Crew Lead: "Prepare to tow. Aircraft [MSN], weight [X] kg, slope [Y]%."
- Brake Rider: Acknowledge
- Tug Operator: Acknowledge
- Wingwalkers: Acknowledge

**4.2 Start Movement**
- Ground Crew Lead: Signal "Start Tow"
- Tug Operator: Apply power smoothly
- Verify aircraft movement smooth and controlled
- Monitor NLG in cradle for stability

### 5. During Tow

**5.1 Speed Control**
- Maximum towing speed: 25 km/h on straight sections
- Reduce to 8 km/h for turns
- Towbarless operations may permit tighter turns than towbar operations

**5.2 Monitoring Requirements**

**Ground Crew Lead:**
- Monitor NLG remains properly captured
- Watch for any unusual gear behavior
- Monitor wingtip and tail clearances
- Maintain continuous communication

**Tug Operator:**
- Monitor lift system hydraulics
- Maintain steady speed
- Avoid sudden movements that could dislodge NLG
- Respond immediately to Ground Crew Lead directions
- Stop immediately on "STOP" command

**Brake Rider:**
- Monitor for any abnormal vibrations (may indicate NLG issue)
- Watch for abnormal aircraft behavior
- Ready to apply brakes in emergency

**Wingwalkers:**
- Monitor wingtip clearances
- Alert Ground Crew Lead of hazards

**5.3 Turns**
- Reduce speed to 8 km/h
- Towbarless tug typically allows tighter turn radius
- Verify clearances before committing to turn
- Complete turn smoothly

### 6. Emergency Stop Procedures

**ANY crew member may initiate emergency stop by calling "STOP"**

**Immediate Actions:**
- Tug Operator: Apply tug brakes smoothly
- Brake Rider: Apply aircraft brakes (use caution, as NLG may be partially lifted)
- Ground Crew Lead: Assess situation

**Additional Towbarless-Specific Stop Reasons:**
- NLG appears to be shifting in cradle
- Lift system malfunction
- Abnormal noise from NLG area
- Tug hydraulic system alert

## Completion of Tow

### 7. Arriving at Destination

**7.1 Final Positioning**
- Align aircraft on parking spot
- Stop smoothly

**7.2 NLG Release Sequence**

*CRITICAL: Release must be performed in controlled manner*

1. **Brake Rider:** Set parking brake

2. **Ground Crew:** Install main gear chocks

3. **Ground Crew Lead:** Verify aircraft secured
   - Parking brake set
   - Chocks installed
   - Aircraft stable

4. **Tug Operator:** Lower cradle to release NLG
   - Lower slowly and evenly
   - Monitor NLG settling onto ground
   - Ensure strut extends to normal position
   - Stop when NLG fully on ground

5. **Ground Crew Lead:** Verify NLG released
   - Visual inspection: NLG on ground, strut extended
   - No binding or interference
   - Tires seated properly

6. **Tug Operator:** Drive tug slowly backward to clear NLG
   - Ground Crew Lead guides tug clear
   - Monitor clearance from aircraft

### 8. Post-Tow Configuration

**8.1 Aircraft Configuration**
- Remove NWS pin (stow properly)
- Verify parking brake set
- Conduct post-tow inspection (see below)

**8.2 Post-Tow NLG Inspection**
