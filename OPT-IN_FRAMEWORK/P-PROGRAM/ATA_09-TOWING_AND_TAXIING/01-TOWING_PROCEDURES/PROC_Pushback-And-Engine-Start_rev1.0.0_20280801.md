# Pushback and Engine Start Procedure
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-08-01  
**Document Type:** PROC  
**Effectivity:** ALL MSN

## Purpose
This procedure defines the approved method for conducting pushback operations combined with engine start for the AMPEL360 aircraft.

## Prerequisites

1. All pre-tow checks completed per CHK_Towing-PrePost-Checklist
2. Aircraft cleared for pushback by ATC
3. Engines cleared for start by maintenance
4. LH₂ system status verified (refer to ATA 28)
5. Ground power available if required
6. Pushback route confirmed and clear

## Environmental Limits

- **Wind:** Maximum 25 knots crosswind
- **Slope:** Maximum 1.5% unless approved by engineering
- **Visibility:** Minimum per airport operating procedures
- **Temperature:** Within engine start envelope

## Personnel Requirements

- Ground Crew Lead (qualified for pushback operations)
- Brake Rider (in cockpit)
- Tug Operator
- Wingwalkers (as required by local procedures)
- Fire Guard (during engine start)

## Equipment Requirements

- Approved pushback tug with adequate DBP for aircraft GW
- Towbar with correct shear pin installed
- Ground-to-cockpit communication (intercom or radio)
- Fire extinguisher (dry chemical or Halon)
- Chocks

## Procedure

### Phase 1: Pre-Pushback Setup

1. **Ground Crew Lead:** Position tug and connect towbar
   - Verify towbar shear pin is correct for current GW
   - Ensure positive lock engagement
   - Check hydraulic connections (if applicable)

2. **Brake Rider:** Verify aircraft ready for pushback
   - Parking brake OFF
   - NWS pin installed and flagged
   - All doors and panels closed
   - Ground power connected if required

3. **Ground Crew Lead:** Complete communication check
   - "Cockpit, Ground. Comms check."
   - Confirm hand signals understood by all personnel

### Phase 2: Pushback Execution

4. **Ground Crew Lead:** Signal "Ready to Push"
   - Verify all personnel in position
   - Check clearance behind aircraft
   - Signal tug operator to begin

5. **Tug Operator:** Begin pushback
   - Start movement slowly
   - Do not exceed 8 km/h
   - Monitor towbar loads
   - Stop immediately on "STOP" command

6. **Brake Rider:** Monitor aircraft systems
   - Verify NWS remains disengaged
   - Monitor hydraulic pressures
   - Ready to apply brakes if needed

7. **Ground Crew Lead:** Direct pushback operation
   - Use standard hand signals
   - Monitor wingtip and tail clearances
   - Verify heading alignment

### Phase 3: Engine Start During Pushback (If Applicable)

8. **Ground Crew Lead:** When at start position, signal "Clear to Start Engines"
   - Position fire guard
   - Verify area clear of FOD
   - Monitor for abnormalities

9. **Brake Rider:** Initiate engine start sequence
   - Follow ATA 71 engine start procedures
   - Monitor all parameters
   - Report any abnormalities immediately

10. **Fire Guard:** Monitor engine start
    - Watch for fire, smoke, or abnormal indications
    - Position extinguisher for immediate use
    - Signal "Normal Start" or "Abort Start" as appropriate

### Phase 4: Disconnect and Clear

11. **Ground Crew Lead:** After pushback complete
    - Signal tug to stop
    - Verify parking brake SET
    - Disconnect towbar

12. **Ground Crew Lead:** Remove all ground equipment
    - Remove NWS pin (if engines running and hydraulics available)
    - Position chocks if engines not started
    - Clear all personnel and equipment
    - Signal "Clear of Aircraft" to cockpit

13. **Brake Rider:** Verify aircraft ready for taxi
    - NWS operational (if pin removed)
    - All systems normal
    - Ground equipment clear

## Stop Procedures

**EMERGENCY STOP:** Any crew member may call "STOP"
- Tug operator: Apply tug brakes immediately
- Brake rider: Apply aircraft brakes
- Ground crew: Signal stop to all personnel
- Determine cause before resuming

## Post-Operation

1. Complete post-tow checklist
2. Log pushback event in LOG_Towing-Events.csv
3. Report any incidents or abnormalities
4. Inspect NLG per post-tow inspection requirements
