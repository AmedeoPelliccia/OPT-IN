2. Prepare to assist with emergency procedures
3. Monitor engine and system parameters
4. Be ready to communicate with ATC

**Standard Announcement (Internal):**
- PF: "Emergency stop, parking brake set"
- PM: "Reason for stop?"
- Crew member who called stop: State reason

### Initial Assessment (First 10 seconds)

**Pilot Flying:**
- Aircraft stopped and stable?
- Immediate fire or danger?
- Safe to remain in position?

**Pilot Monitoring:**
- Check caution/warning messages
- Assess system status
- Determine if immediate evacuation needed

## Category-Specific Procedures

### Category 1: Fire or Smoke

**Engine Fire During Taxi:**
1. STOP immediately (as above)
2. Execute Engine Fire Checklist
3. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on [location], engine fire"
4. If fire not contained: Order evacuation
5. If fire contained: Request fire services to inspect before moving

**Cargo or Cabin Fire/Smoke:**
1. STOP immediately
2. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on [location], [fire/smoke] in [location]"
3. Request immediate fire services
4. Assess need for evacuation
5. If evacuation required: Execute emergency evacuation
6. If contained: Do not move aircraft until fire services inspect

**Do NOT attempt to taxi with active fire**

### Category 2: Landing Gear or Steering Malfunction

**Loss of Steering:**
1. STOP using brakes
2. Set parking brake
3. Assess:
   - NWS failure (tiller/pedals unresponsive)
   - Hydraulic system failure
   - Gear damage
4. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on [location], loss of steering"
5. If NWS failure only and differential braking available:
   - May attempt slow taxi to clear runway/taxiway
   - Request tow to gate
6. If no directional control: Request tow from current position

**Suspected Gear Damage:**
1. STOP if safe to do so
2. Set parking brake
3. If damage suspected during taxi (vibration, noise, handling):
   - Request ground inspection
   - Do NOT continue taxi until cleared
4. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on [location], suspected gear damage"
5. Request ground personnel or fire services to inspect
6. If damage confirmed: Request tow to gate or maintenance area

**Tire Failure/Flat Tire:**
1. STOP when safe
2. Set parking brake
3. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on [location], suspected tire failure"
4. Request ground inspection
5. If tire flat but gear intact, may be able to taxi slowly to clear active area
6. Request tow if tire damage severe or multiple tires affected

### Category 3: Engine Malfunction

**Engine Failure During Taxi:**
1. Stop aircraft
2. If single engine failure on multi-engine aircraft:
   - Execute Engine Failure Checklist
   - Assess if taxi can continue on remaining engine(s)
   - Consider weight, taxi distance, and aircraft handling
3. If unable to continue: Request tow
4. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on [location], engine failure"

**Engine Parameters Abnormal:**
1. Stop aircraft if parameters outside limits
2. Execute appropriate abnormal checklist
3. Assess if safe to continue
4. If returning to gate, consider:
   - Can engine be shut down for taxi back?
   - Risk of further damage vs. short taxi
5. Notify maintenance before arriving at gate

### Category 4: Hydraulic or Brake Failure

**Loss of Brakes:**
1. If one brake system remains: Use carefully to stop
2. If total brake loss:
   - Reduce speed with thrust reduction
   - Consider engine reverse (if available and trained)
   - Use runway overrun area if necessary
3. Once stopped, DO NOT move aircraft
4. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on [location], brake failure"
5. Request tow to gate
6. If on runway: Advise ATC, request removal ASAP

**Hydraulic System Failure:**
1. Stop and assess:
   - Which systems affected?
   - Brakes available?
   - Steering available?
2. Execute hydraulic failure checklist
3. If backup systems provide brakes and steering: May continue to gate
4. If no brakes or steering: Request tow
5. Notify ATC and maintenance

### Category 5: LH₂ Fuel System Abnormality

**LH₂ System Warning (refer to ATA 28):**
1. STOP immediately
2. Execute LH₂ System Abnormal Checklist
3. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on [location], fuel system warning"
4. Request fire services to standby
5. If leak suspected:
   - Evacuate if directed by checklist
   - Establish safety perimeter
   - Wait for hazmat team
6. Do NOT taxi with suspected LH₂ leak

**Cryogenic System Overpressure:**
1. Follow ATA 28 procedures
2. Consider environmental factors (temperature, wind)
3. May need to vent system (follow checklist)
4. Notify ATC and request guidance
5. Do not proceed until system stabilized

### Category 6: Other System Malfunctions

**Electrical System Failure:**
- Assess impact on essential systems (comms, nav, lights)
- If flight can continue: May taxi to runway
- If flight cannot continue: Return to gate

**Navigation System Failure:**
- In VMC: Continue with visual navigation
- In LVO: Return to gate

**Communication System Failure:**
- Use backup comm systems
- If all comm failed: Use light gun signals
- May need ground marshalling to return to gate

## Decision to Return to Gate

### Factors to Consider

1. **Safety:**
   - Can aircraft be taxied safely?
   - Risk to occupants?
   - Risk to other aircraft or airport operations?

2. **Operational:**
   - Can flight continue after inspection/repair?
   - Time required for repair?
   - Passenger considerations?

3. **Regulatory:**
   - Does malfunction require maintenance action before flight?
   - MEL applicability?
   - Reporting requirements?

### Decision Matrix

| Malfunction | Continue to Takeoff? | Return to Gate? | Tow Required? |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Engine failure (multi-engine) | Maybe | Likely | No |
| Single engine failure (twin) | No | Yes | Maybe |
| Brake failure | No | Yes | Yes |
| NWS failure | No | Yes | Likely |
| Hydraulic failure (partial) | Maybe | Maybe | No |
| LH₂ leak suspected | No | Yes | Yes |
| Tire failure | No | Yes | Maybe |
| Fire (contained) | No | Yes | No |

## Returning to Gate

### Taxi Back to Gate (Self-Powered)

**Prerequisites:**
- Aircraft controllable
- No fire or major damage
- Brakes and steering functional
- Engines operating within limits

**Procedure:**
1. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], request taxi back to gate [or stand], [reason]"
2. ATC will provide taxi clearance or instructions
3. Brief return route with PM
4. Taxi at reduced speed (maximum 10 knots)
5. Monitor malfunctioning system closely
6. Be prepared to stop if condition worsens

**Considerations:**
- Weight: Aircraft may be above maximum taxi weight if fully fueled
- Fuel dumping: Usually not required for taxi back (unless structural)
- Brake energy: Monitor carefully if returning with high weight

**At Gate:**
1. Notify ground crew of malfunction
2. Request appropriate ground support (maintenance, stairs, etc.)
3. Complete parking checklist
4. Do not deplane passengers until cleared by maintenance if safety concern

### Tow Back to Gate

**Request Tow When:**
- Unable to taxi (no steering or brakes)
- Risk of further damage if taxied
- On runway and must be removed quickly
- LH₂ system issue requiring special handling

**Procedure:**
1. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], unable to taxi, request tow to gate"
2. Set parking brake, shut down engines (if safe and appropriate)
3. Configure aircraft for towing:
   - Install NWS pin (if hydraulics failed)
   - Ensure parking brake off before tow begins
   - Brake rider remains in cockpit (if hydraulics available)
4. Follow procedures in PROC_Towing-With-Towbar or PROC_Towing-Towbarless-ADB
5. Complete CHK_Towing-PrePost-Checklist

**Safety Considerations:**
- If aircraft damaged, special tow procedures may be required
- Structural inspection before tow if gear or structural damage suspected
- Fire services escort if fire or fuel leak involved

## Runway Occupancy

If stopped on runway:

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Notify ATC: "[Callsign], stopped on runway [identifier], unable to taxi, [reason]"
2. ATC will close runway and coordinate removal
3. If aircraft blocking runway: High priority to clear
4. Options:
   - If able: Taxi clear using remaining systems
   - If unable: Expedited tow
   - If extensive damage: May require specialized equipment

**Passenger Management:**
- Inform cabin crew of situation
- Passenger announcement (brief, calm, accurate)
- No evacuation unless fire, smoke, or directed by checklist
- If runway occupancy extended: Keep passengers informed

## Emergency Evacuation During Taxi

**Evacuation Criteria:**
- Uncontained fire
- Smoke in cabin threatening safety
- Structural failure endangering occupants
- LH₂ leak with ignition risk
- Any situation where remaining in aircraft is more dangerous than evacuating

**Procedure:**
1. STOP aircraft immediately
2. Set parking brake
3. PF: "EMERGENCY EVACUATION"
4. Execute Emergency Evacuation Checklist
5. Cabin crew directs evacuation
6. Flight crew last to leave after ensuring all passengers evacuated

**Caution:** Evacuation on taxiway/runway exposes passengers to:
- Other aircraft
- Ground vehicles
- Jet blast
- Weather

Evacuate only when necessary. If possible, move aircraft to safer area first.

## Documentation and Reporting

After any emergency stop or return to gate:

1. **Logbook Entry:**
   - Describe malfunction and actions taken
   - Maintenance action required before next flight

2. **Company Notification:**
   - Notify dispatch and maintenance control
   - Company may have specific reporting requirements

3. **Regulatory Reporting:**
   - Some malfunctions require reports to aviation authority
   - Coordinate with company and maintenance

4. **Incident Report:**
   - Complete REPORT_Incident-Template if applicable
   - Log in incident database

5. **Taxi Event Log:**
   - If taxi attempted, log in LOG_Taxi-Profiles.csv
   - Note malfunction and outcome
