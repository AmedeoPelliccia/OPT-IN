# Low Visibility Operations (LVO) Taxiing Procedure
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-08-01  
**Document Type:** PROC  
**Effectivity:** ALL MSN

## Purpose
This procedure defines taxiing operations for the AMPEL360 aircraft during low visibility conditions, typically when RVR (Runway Visual Range) is below 400 meters or as defined by local airport LVO criteria.

## Scope
This procedure supplements PROC_Taxiing-Under-Own-Power and provides additional requirements for taxi operations in reduced visibility.

## Applicability

Low Visibility Operations (LVO) procedures apply when:
- RVR less than 400 meters, OR
- Visibility less than 400 meters, OR
- Airport declares LVO in effect, OR
- Flight crew determines reduced visibility warrants enhanced procedures

## Prerequisites

### Operational Requirements
1. Aircraft equipped and serviceable for LVO operations
2. Flight crew qualified and current for LVO operations
3. Airport certified for LVO operations
4. ATC LVO procedures in effect
5. Enhanced ground lighting and markings operational

### Equipment Requirements
- Enhanced Vision System (EVS) operational (if equipped)
- All exterior lights operational and functioning
- Navigation displays showing airport moving map
- ADS-B traffic display operational
- Transponder operational

### Crew Requirements
- Both pilots qualified for LVO operations (training within 12 months)
- LVO briefing completed
- Sterile cockpit procedures strictly enforced

## LVO-Specific Procedures

### Pre-Taxi Briefing

**Enhanced Briefing Items:**
1. **Taxi Route:**
   - Review complete route on airport diagram
   - Identify all turns, hold points, and runway crossings
   - Note taxiway widths and any restrictions
   - Identify complex areas or hot spots

2. **Lighting and Markings:**
   - Confirm taxiway centerline lights operational
   - Verify edge lights and stop bars functional
   - Note any lighting outages reported by ATC

3. **Contingency Planning:**
   - Plan for "lost on airport" scenario
   - Identify safe areas to stop and reassess
   - Agree on decision point to return to gate if conditions worsen

4. **Communication:**
   - Confirm radio frequencies
   - Review progressive taxi procedures
   - Establish internal callout standards

5. **Technology:**
   - Enable airport moving map on navigation displays
   - Set up EVS display (if available)
   - Configure traffic display

### Taxi Clearance and Routing

**Progressive Taxi:**
In LVO conditions, ATC may provide progressive taxi instructions:
- Clearance given for one segment at a time
- Expect multiple stops and holds
- Read back all clearances precisely
- Do not proceed beyond cleared point

**Route Selection:**
- ATC may assign routes with enhanced lighting
- Avoid routes with known poor visibility areas
- Request alternate routing if unsure of clearance

### Speed Limitations

**LVO Taxi Speeds (more restrictive than normal):**
- **Straight Sections:** Maximum 15 knots groundspeed
- **Turns:** Maximum 5 knots groundspeed
- **Approaching Intersections:** Maximum 10 knots groundspeed
- **Enhanced Caution Areas:** Maximum 5 knots groundspeed

**Rationale:** Reduced speed provides more time to:
- Verify position
- Identify markings and signs
- React to obstacles or traffic
- Stop safely if disoriented

### Taxi Procedures - LVO Specific

#### Starting Movement

1. **Enhanced External Light Configuration**
   - Beacon ON
   - Navigation lights ON
   - Strobe lights ON
   - Taxi lights ON (consider alternate or both)
   - Landing lights ON (use takeoff setting for maximum visibility)
   - Logo/wing lights ON (enhances visibility to others)

2. **Confirm Position**
   - Verify aircraft position on airport diagram
   - Cross-check with GPS/moving map
   - Verify with ATC if any doubt
   - Note nearest taxiway identifier

3. **Read Back Clearance**
   - Read back complete clearance with all taxiway identifiers
   - Include "to" and "via" points
   - Include any hold short instructions

#### During Taxi

**Crew Coordination (Enhanced):**

**Pilot Flying (PF):**
- Controls aircraft, primary focus outside
- Follows taxiway centerline lights
- Calls out "Centerline in sight" or "Centerline lost"
- Stops immediately if position uncertain

**Pilot Monitoring (PM):**
- Monitors airport diagram and position
- Confirms taxiway identifiers as passed
- Calls out upcoming turns and hold points
- Monitors ATC communications
- Ready to assume control if PF disoriented

**Standard Callouts:**
- PM: "Next turn right onto [taxiway], [distance]"
- PF: "Roger, right turn onto [taxiway]"
- PM: Approaching turn: "Slowing for turn"
- PM: At turn: "Turn right now, [taxiway] identifier ahead"
- PF: "Turning right, [taxiway] in sight"
- PM: After turn: "On [taxiway], cleared to [next point]"

**Position Verification:**
At each taxiway intersection or when passing identifiable features:
- PM: "Passing [taxiway identifier]"
- PF: "Confirm [taxiway identifier]"
- PM: "Position confirmed on moving map"

**Following Centerline:**
- PF focuses on taxiway centerline lights
- Maintain nose wheel on centerline
- If centerline lights lost, stop immediately
- Do not continue based on memory or assumption

#### Turns in LVO

1. **Before Turn:**
   - Reduce to 5 knots well before turn point
   - PM: Confirm taxiway identifier at intersection
   - Both pilots verify correct turn direction

2. **Initiating Turn:**
   - PF: Watch for new taxiway centerline lights
   - Turn slowly, maintain visual contact with centerline lights
   - Do not turn if lights not visible

3. **Completing Turn:**
   - Verify on new taxiway centerline
   - PM: Confirm taxiway identifier
   - PF: Confirm centerline in sight

#### Holds and Stop Bars

**Stop Bar Discipline:**
- NEVER cross an illuminated red stop bar
- Stop before red stop bar (nose gear behind bar)
- Wait for stop bar to extinguish before crossing
- If stop bar extinguishes without clearance, query ATC

**Holding Position:**
- Stop with nose gear on hold line
- Set parking brake if hold expected to exceed 30 seconds
- Maintain position awareness
- PM: Monitor moving map and confirm position

**Runway Crossing:**
Even more critical in LVO:
1. Obtain explicit clearance with runway identifier
2. Read back clearance including "cross runway [identifier]"
3. Stop before runway edge
4. Look for traffic (use all available technology)
5. Cross expeditiously without stopping
6. Report clear of runway to ATC

#### Technology Use

**Moving Map Display:**
- Monitor continuously
- Cross-check with visual cues
- Alert if discrepancy between map and visual
- Do not rely solely on moving map (guidance only)

**EVS (if available):**
- Use as supplementary reference
- Enhances visibility of markings and lights
- Do not use as sole means of navigation
- Be aware of EVS limitations (ghosting, parallax)

**Traffic Display:**
- Monitor for traffic conflicts
- Enhanced importance in low visibility
- Report traffic observed on display but not visually

### Lost Position Procedures

If crew uncertain of position:

1. **Stop Immediately**
   - PF: "Stopping, position uncertain"
   - Apply brakes smoothly
   - Set parking brake

2. **Assess Situation**
   - Review airport diagram
   - Check moving map position
   - Look for any visible taxiway identifiers or signs
   - Note any landmarks (if visible)

3. **Notify ATC**
   - "ATC, [callsign] is stopped on taxiway, position uncertain"
   - Provide any information available (last known position, visible signs)

4. **ATC Assistance**
   - ATC may provide progressive instructions
   - ATC may use ground radar to confirm position
   - Follow-me vehicle may be dispatched

5. **Do Not:**
   - Guess or assume position
   - Continue taxiing hoping to find landmark
   - Turn around or back-taxi without clearance

### Deteriorating Conditions

If visibility decreases during taxi:

1. Slow down or stop
2. Reassess conditions
3. Consider:
   - Continue with extreme caution
   - Request progressive taxi
   - Return to gate

**Return to Gate:**
If conditions become unacceptable:
- Notify ATC: "Request progressive taxi return to gate, visibility inadequate"
- Refer to PROC_Emergency-Stop-And-Return for return procedures

## Training and Qualification

Flight crew must complete:
- LVO ground school (initial and recurrent)
- LVO simulator training including lost position scenarios
- Line training under supervision for first LVO operations
- Currency: LVO operation within 12 months

- LVO operations significantly increase workload
- Fatigue factor is higher in LVO conditions
- Crew coordination is critical
- When in doubt, STOP
