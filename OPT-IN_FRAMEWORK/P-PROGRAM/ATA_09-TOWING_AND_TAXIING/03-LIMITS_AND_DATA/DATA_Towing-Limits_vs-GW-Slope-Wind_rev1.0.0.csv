185000,0.0,0,0,250,25,"Level apron, no wind, baseline conditions"
185000,0.5,0,0,270,25,"Slight uphill slope, minimal increase in DBP required"
185000,1.0,10,5,350,15,"Uphill tow, headwind assists braking, verify tug DBP"
185000,1.5,0,0,380,12,"Maximum approved slope, reduced speed mandatory"
210000,0.0,0,0,280,25,"Increased weight, level surface"
210000,0.0,0,15,280,20,"MTOW, crosswind requires reduced speed for stability"
210000,0.5,0,10,310,20,"MTOW, slight slope and crosswind"
210000,1.0,0,0,400,15,"MTOW, uphill, approaching tug limits for most tugs"
210000,1.5,0,0,450,10,"MTOW, maximum slope, heavy-duty tug required"
175000,0.0,0,20,260,18,"Light weight but high crosswind, reduced speed"
175000,1.0,15,10,330,18,"Light weight, uphill, crosswind and headwind"
200000,0.0,5,8,290,22,"Near MTOW, light winds, standard tow"
200000,0.8,0,12,340,18,"Near MTOW, moderate slope and crosswind"
185000,0.0,10,0,240,25,"Headwind assists, DBP slightly reduced"
185000,0.0,0,25,260,15,"Maximum crosswind for pushback, reduced speed critical"
