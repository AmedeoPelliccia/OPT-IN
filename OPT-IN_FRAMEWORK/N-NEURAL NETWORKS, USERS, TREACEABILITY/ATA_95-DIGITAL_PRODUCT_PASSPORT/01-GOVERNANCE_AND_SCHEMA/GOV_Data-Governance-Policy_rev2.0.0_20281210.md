# Data Governance Policy
**Document ID:** GOV_Data-Governance-Policy  
**Revision:** 2.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-12-10  
**Owner:** Data Governance Board  
**Classification:** INTERNAL

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This policy establishes the data governance framework for the AMPEL360 Digital Product Passport (DPP) system. It defines data ownership, stewardship, quality standards, retention policies, and access controls applicable to all aircraft lifecycle data.

## 2. Governance Structure

### 2.1 Data Governance Board
- **Composition:** Chief Architect, Head of Airworthiness, Data Privacy Officer, Security Officer
- **Responsibilities:** 
  - Approve data classification schemes
  - Review and approve schema changes
  - Resolve data ownership disputes
  - Enforce compliance with regulatory requirements

### 2.2 Data Stewards
- **Role:** Designated technical owners for each data domain (aircraft, parts, events, analytics)
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Maintain schema documentation
  - Validate data quality
  - Coordinate with cross-functional teams on data requirements

## 3. Data Classification

All data in the DPP system is classified according to sensitivity:

| Classification | Description | Examples | Access Controls |
|:---------------|:------------|:---------|:----------------|
| **PUBLIC** | Non-sensitive information | Model designations, public certifications | Open read access |
| **INTERNAL** | Internal operational data | Flight schedules, maintenance planning | Role-based read access |
| **REGULATED** | Airworthiness and compliance data | Airworthiness certificates, maintenance records | Strict role-based access with audit logging |
| **PII-SENSITIVE** | Personally identifiable information | Crew records, passenger data | Encrypted storage, minimal access with explicit consent |

## 4. Data Quality Standards

### 4.1 Completeness
- All mandatory fields in schemas must be populated
- Missing data must be explicitly marked as "NOT_AVAILABLE" with justification

### 4.2 Accuracy
- Data must be traceable to authoritative source systems
- Automated validation rules enforce referential integrity

### 4.3 Timeliness
- Critical airworthiness data must be updated within 4 hours of event occurrence
- Non-critical data updates within 24 hours

### 4.4 Consistency
- All dates/times in UTC ISO 8601 format
- All identifiers follow URN scheme: `urn:ampel360:<domain>:<id>`

## 5. Schema Governance

### 5.1 Schema Versioning
- Schemas follow semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Breaking changes require MAJOR version increment
- All schema changes reviewed by Data Governance Board

### 5.2 Schema Registry
- All schemas stored in `/01-GOVERNANCE_AND_SCHEMA/schemas/`
- JSON Schema format (Draft 2020-12)
- Schema validation mandatory for all data ingestion

## 6. Data Retention and Archival

### 6.1 Retention Periods
- **Event Ledger:** Indefinite retention (regulatory requirement)
- **Passport Data:** 10 years post-aircraft decommissioning
- **Analytics Models:** 5 years post-model retirement
- **Audit Logs:** 7 years (regulatory requirement)

### 6.2 Archival Process
- Data older than active retention period moved to cold storage
- Archived data remains cryptographically verifiable
- Retrieval process documented in operational procedures

## 7. Data Security and Privacy

### 7.1 Cryptographic Standards
- **Signing Algorithm:** Ed25519
- **Hashing Algorithm:** SHA-256
- **Transparency Log:** All critical events anchored in Merkle tree

### 7.2 Encryption
- PII-SENSITIVE data encrypted at rest using AES-256-GCM
- Encryption keys managed via HSM (Hardware Security Module)
- Key rotation every 12 months

### 7.3 Access Logging
- All data access logged with timestamp, user ID, and action type
- Logs reviewed quarterly by Security Officer

## 8. Compliance and Audit

### 8.1 Regulatory Compliance
- EASA Part-M (Continuing Airworthiness)
- EASA Part-145 (Approved Maintenance Organizations)
- ISO 8000 (Data Quality)
- GDPR (for PII data)

### 8.2 Internal Audits
- Quarterly data quality audits
- Annual security and privacy audits
- Findings tracked in `/07-AUDIT_AND_COMPLIANCE/`

## 9. Change Management

### 9.1 Policy Updates
- Minor updates reviewed and approved by Data Governance Board
- Major updates require executive approval
- All stakeholders notified 30 days before effective date

### 9.2 Communication
- Policy published in central document repository
- Training provided to all data stewards and system administrators

## 10. Contacts and References

### 10.1 Key Contacts
- **Data Governance Board Chair:** TBD
- **Data Privacy Officer:** TBD
- **Security Officer:** TBD

### 10.2 Related Documents
