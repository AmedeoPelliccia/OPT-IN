# ATA 95: Digital Product Passport & Traceability

This chapter defines the data architecture and governance standards for the aircraft's entire lifecycle. The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is the authoritative, verifiable, and immutable digital twin of the aircraft, its components, and its operational history.

## Architectural Principles
*   **Single Source of Truth:** The DPP is the federated source for all configuration, maintenance, and operational data.
*   **Cryptographic Immutability:** Key events are recorded in an `EVENT_LEDGER` with hash-chaining and are anchored in a transparency log, ensuring a tamper-evident audit trail.
*   **Comprehensive Traceability:** Every component is traced from its origin to its current state.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access is governed by a formal policy, with data classification levels protecting sensitive and PII information.
