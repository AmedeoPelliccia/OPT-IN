# Zonal Inspection Program - Master Diagrams and Tasks
**Aircraft Type:** AMPEL360 Blended-Wing Body Hydrogen Aircraft  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

---

## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The Zonal Inspection Program (ZIP) provides systematic general visual inspections of the aircraft divided into specific zones. Unlike system-specific or structural NDT inspections, zonal inspections focus on:
- General condition assessment
- Fluid leaks
- Structural damage not requiring NDT
- System discrepancies
- Cleanliness and Foreign Object Debris (FOD)
- Loose or missing hardware

### 1.2 Inspection Philosophy
Zonal inspections are **scheduled inspections** performed at defined intervals regardless of component condition. They serve as a "safety net" to detect issues not captured by system-specific monitoring or condition-based maintenance.

### 1.3 Integration with Other Inspection Programs
The ZIP complements:
- **System-specific inspections:** Detailed functional tests and measurements
- **Structural inspections:** NDT and SHM-based assessments
- **Condition monitoring:** Continuous sensor-based monitoring (ATA 45)

## 7.0 Integration with Digital Product Passport (ATA 95)

All zonal inspection data shall be recorded in the DPP, including:
- Inspection completion date and aircraft total time
- Zone inspected
- Findings and classifications
- Corrective actions taken
- Technician identity and license number

This data enables:
- Trend analysis (zones with recurring issues)
- Predictive maintenance (identify degradation patterns)
- Regulatory compliance documentation

---

## 8.0 Revision and Continuous Improvement

### 8.1 Zone Redefinition
Based on operational experience, zones may be:
- Subdivided (if too complex for single inspection)
- Combined (if minimal inspection items)
- Reclassified (if access or systems change)

### 8.2 Interval Adjustments
Inspection intervals may be adjusted based on:
- Reliability data (extend if no findings)
- Environmental factors (reduce if harsh environment)
- Regulatory requirements

All changes require approval per `PROC_Maintenance-Program-Escalation-And-Revision.md`.
