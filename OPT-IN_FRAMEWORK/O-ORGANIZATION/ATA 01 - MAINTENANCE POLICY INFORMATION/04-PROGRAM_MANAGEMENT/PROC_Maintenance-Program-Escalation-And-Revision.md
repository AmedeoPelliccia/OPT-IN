## 1.0 Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the processes and procedures for escalating maintenance findings, revising maintenance program requirements, and managing deviations from the approved Maintenance Planning Document (MPD). It ensures that operational experience is captured and the maintenance program is continuously improved.

### 1.2 Scope
This procedure applies to:
- Unexpected maintenance findings requiring immediate action
- Proposed maintenance program revisions based on reliability data
- Temporary deviations from the MPD
- Alternative Means of Compliance (AMOC) requests
- Mandatory modifications and service bulletins

### 1.3 Regulatory Basis
- **FAA:** 14 CFR §121.369 (Manual Requirements), §121.373 (Continuing Analysis and Surveillance)
- **EASA:** Part-M Subpart G (Continuing Airworthiness Management), Part-145 (Approved Maintenance Organizations)

## 2.0 Escalation Triggers

### 2.1 Immediate Escalation Events
The following findings require immediate escalation to the Maintenance Program Manager and Design Organization:

#### 2.1.1 Safety-Critical Findings
- **Structural cracks** in primary load-bearing members exceeding SRM limits
- **Hydrogen system leaks** exceeding 100 ppm concentration
- **Battery thermal events** (temperature > 80°C)
- **Control system malfunctions** affecting flight safety
- **Fire detection/protection system failures**

**Action:** Ground aircraft until engineering disposition obtained.

#### 2.1.2 Recurring Defects
- Same component failure **3 times within 1000 flight hours** on single aircraft
- Same component failure **5 times fleet-wide within 10,000 flight hours**
- Maintenance task consistently finding unacceptable conditions

**Action:** Initiate reliability investigation.

#### 2.1.3 Maintenance Program Ineffectiveness
- Component failure **before scheduled inspection** detects degradation
- Inspection finds **no degradation** at scheduled interval (potential over-maintenance)
- **False alerts** from condition monitoring systems (>10% false positive rate)

**Action:** Review task interval and method.

## 4.0 Maintenance Program Revisions

### 4.1 Revision Types

#### 4.1.1 Temporary Revision (TR)
**Definition:** Short-term change to address immediate operational need, valid for <12 months.

**Examples:**
- Accelerated inspection due to specific operational environment (e.g., salt water operations)
- Temporary interval extension due to parts shortage (if safety case supports)

**Approval Required:** Maintenance Program Manager + Principal Maintenance Inspector (PMI)

#### 4.1.2 Permanent Revision (PR)
**Definition:** Long-term change to MPD based on demonstrated reliability or engineering analysis.

**Examples:**
- Interval extension after 50,000 fleet FH with no findings
- Interval reduction due to higher-than-expected degradation rate
- Task addition for newly-discovered failure mode

**Approval Required:** Design Organization + Regulatory Authority (EASA/FAA)

#### 4.1.3 Alternative Means of Compliance (AMOC)
**Definition:** Different method to accomplish the same safety objective as original MPD task.

**Examples:**
- Use of advanced NDT method instead of traditional UT
- Condition monitoring replaces scheduled inspection
- Different test equipment achieving same measurement accuracy

**Approval Required:** Regulatory Authority (FAA/EASA) via formal AMOC request
