| **Hazardous** | Large reduction in safety margins | Extremely Remote (<10⁻⁷) | Loss of all flight displays |
| **Major** | Significant reduction in safety margins | Remote (<10⁻⁵) | Loss of single engine |
| **Minor** | Slight reduction in safety margins | Probable (<10⁻³) | Loss of cabin lighting |
| **No Safety Effect** | No effect on safety | No Probability | Passenger entertainment failure |

### 5.2 Development Assurance Levels
