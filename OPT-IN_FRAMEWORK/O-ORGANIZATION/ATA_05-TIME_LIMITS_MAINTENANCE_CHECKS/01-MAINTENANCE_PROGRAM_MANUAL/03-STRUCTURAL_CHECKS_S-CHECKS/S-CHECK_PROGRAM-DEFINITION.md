**Document ID:** S-CHECK_Program-Definition

## 1.0 Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
S-Checks (Structural Checks) are specialized inspection checks focused on airworthiness limitations and structural integrity. These checks are primarily driven by Airworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) requirements and address fatigue-critical structure.

### 1.2 Philosophy
S-Checks are designed to:
- Ensure structural integrity of aging aircraft
- Detect fatigue cracking before it becomes critical
- Comply with ALS mandated inspections
- Maintain airworthiness of BWB composite structure
- Verify continuing structural airworthiness

### 1.3 Interval Strategy
S-Checks are performed at intervals based on Flight Cycles (FC):
- **S01:** 10,000 FC
- **S02:** 20,000 FC

Flight Cycles are used because fatigue damage is primarily cycle-dependent.
