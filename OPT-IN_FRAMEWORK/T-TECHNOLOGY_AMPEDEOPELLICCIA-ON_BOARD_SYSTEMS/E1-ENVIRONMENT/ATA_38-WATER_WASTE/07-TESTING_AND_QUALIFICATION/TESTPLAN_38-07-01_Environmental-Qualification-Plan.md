# TESTPLAN_38-07-01 — Environmental Qualification Plan
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Environmental Systems Engineering

## Purpose
Define environmental qualification testing for water/waste system components.

## Test Scope
All system components exposed to aircraft environmental conditions must be qualified.

## Environmental Conditions
- Temperature: -40°C to +85°C
- Altitude: Sea level to 45,000 ft
- Vibration: Per DO-160 Category S (Standard)
- Humidity: 5% to 95% RH
- Pressure cycling: Ground to cruise altitude
- Contamination: Dust, salt spray, fluids

## Test Sequence
1. **Initial Inspection:** Document baseline condition, measurements, photos
2. **Functional Test:** Verify operation at ambient conditions
3. **Temperature Cycling:** -40°C to +85°C, 10 cycles minimum
4. **Altitude/Pressure:** Simulate flight profile, 50 cycles
5. **Vibration:** Per DO-160 random vibration profile, 3 axes
6. **Humidity:** 95% RH at elevated temperature, 48 hours
7. **Post-Test Functional:** Verify continued operation
8. **Final Inspection:** Document any changes or degradation

## Acceptance Criteria
- No leakage at any condition
- Functional performance within specification
- No structural damage or permanent deformation
- Electrical parameters within tolerance (if applicable)

## Documentation
Complete test report with all data, environmental chamber logs, photos, and SHA-256 hashes for all evidence.
