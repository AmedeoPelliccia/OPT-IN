- Verify pump starts and stops at correct pressures
- Check check valve function (no backflow audible)
- Test pressure relief valve (pop test if due per schedule)

### Bench Testing

Per [PROC_38-04-02_Pump-Bench-Test-And-Calib.md](PROC_38-04-02_Pump-Bench-Test-And-Calib.md):

**Pump Bench Test:**
- Performed before installation (new/repaired pumps)
- Performed at overhaul intervals (typically 5000 hours or 5 years)

- Solenoid valve response time (if failure suspected)

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

#### Pump Issues

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Corrective Action |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Pump won't start | No power, blown breaker, faulty switch | Check electrical, test switch |
| Low pressure | Worn impeller, air in system, leak | Bleed air, test output, inspect for leaks |
| High current draw | Bearing wear, blocked discharge | Check rotation, remove blockage |
| Excessive noise | Cavitation, bearing wear, loose mount | Check suction, tighten mounts, replace bearings |
| Rapid cycling | Leak in system, accumulator fault | Pressure test system, check accumulator |

#### Valve Issues

| Symptom | Possible Cause | Corrective Action |
|---------|----------------|-------------------|
| Valve won't close | Debris, worn seal, spring failure | Disassemble and clean, replace seal |
| Leaking when closed | Worn seat, debris | Inspect and clean seat, replace if damaged |
| Hard to operate | Corrosion, overtightening | Lubricate with food-grade lubricant, check torque |
| Check valve chatter | Undersized, turbulent flow | Verify sizing, add damping |
| Solenoid won't open | No power, coil burnout, plunger stuck | Test voltage, check coil resistance, clean plunger |
