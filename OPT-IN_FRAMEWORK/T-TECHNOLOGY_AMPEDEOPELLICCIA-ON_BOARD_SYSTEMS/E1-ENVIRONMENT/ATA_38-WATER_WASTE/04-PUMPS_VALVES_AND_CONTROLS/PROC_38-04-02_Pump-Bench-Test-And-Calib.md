# PROC_38-04-02 — Pump Bench Test and Calibration
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Environmental Systems Engineering

## Purpose
Bench test and calibrate pumps and valves for water/waste systems.

## Equipment Required
- Flow meter (calibrated)
- Pressure gauges (calibrated)
- Test fluid (clean water or appropriate simulant)
- Torque wrench
- Data acquisition system

## Test Procedure
1. Visual inspection for damage, corrosion, or contamination
2. Verify part number, serial number, and configuration
3. Install pump on test bench with appropriate connections
4. Flow test at rated conditions
5. Pressure test at maximum rated pressure
6. Leak test at service pressure
7. Performance curve verification
8. Vibration and noise measurement
9. Electrical parameter verification (current, voltage)
10. Record all data with timestamps and attach SHA-256

## Acceptance Criteria
- Flow rate within ±5% of specification
- Pressure within ±2% of specification
- Zero leakage at service pressure
- Vibration and noise within limits
- Electrical parameters within tolerance

## Documentation
Complete bench test report with all measurements, attach calibration certificates for test equipment, and update DPP.
