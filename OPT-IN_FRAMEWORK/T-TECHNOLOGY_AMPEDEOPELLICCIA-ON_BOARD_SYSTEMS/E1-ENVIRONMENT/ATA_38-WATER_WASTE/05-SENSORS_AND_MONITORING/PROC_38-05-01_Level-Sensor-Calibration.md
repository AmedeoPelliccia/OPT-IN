# PROC_38-05-01 — Level Sensor Calibration
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Environmental Systems Engineering

## Purpose
Calibrate level sensors for water and waste tanks to ensure accurate monitoring.

## Equipment Required
- Calibrated reference level measurement device
- Multimeter (calibrated)
- Test fluid or simulant
- Calibration fixture/tank
- Data logger

## Procedure
1. Verify sensor part number and serial number
2. Visual inspection for damage or contamination
3. Install sensor in calibration fixture
4. Zero point calibration (empty tank)
5. Full scale calibration (full tank)
6. Multi-point verification (25%, 50%, 75% levels)
7. Repeatability test (3 cycles)
8. Hysteresis check (up and down sweep)
9. Temperature compensation verification
10. Record calibration data with timestamps and SHA-256

## Acceptance Criteria
- Accuracy: ±1% of full scale
- Repeatability: ±0.5% of reading
- Hysteresis: <0.5% of full scale
- Temperature coefficient within specification

## Documentation
Complete calibration certificate with next due date, attach to DPP, and affix calibration sticker.
