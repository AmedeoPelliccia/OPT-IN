## Purpose

This chapter provides comprehensive procedures, specifications, and records for the design, operation, maintenance, and certification of potable water and waste systems aboard AMPEL360 aircraft. It ensures compliance with aviation safety standards, public health regulations, and environmental protection requirements.

## Scope

This documentation covers all aspects of water and waste management systems:

- **Potable Water Systems:** Supply, storage, distribution, quality monitoring, and sanitization
- **Waste Systems:** Collection tanks (gray water, black water), drainage, venting, and disposal
- **System Components:** Pumps, valves, sensors, filters, and monitoring equipment
- **Quality Assurance:** Testing, inspection, calibration, and certification procedures
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Mapping to FAA, EASA, NSF, WHO, and EPA requirements
- **Traceability:** Digital Product Passport (DPP) integration and chain-of-custody documentation
