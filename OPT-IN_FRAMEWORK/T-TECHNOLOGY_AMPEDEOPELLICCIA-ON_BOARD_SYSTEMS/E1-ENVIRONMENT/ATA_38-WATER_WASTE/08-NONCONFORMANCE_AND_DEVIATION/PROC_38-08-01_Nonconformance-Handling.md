Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Environmental Systems Engineering

## Purpose
Define process for identifying, documenting, and dispositioning nonconformances in water/waste systems.

## Scope
All deviations from specifications, procedures, or regulatory requirements.

## Identification
Nonconformances may be identified through:
- Inspection findings
- Test failures
- In-service issues
- Audit findings
- Supplier notifications

## Classification
- **Critical:** Safety impact or regulatory non-compliance
- **Major:** Performance significantly degraded
- **Minor:** Performance slightly degraded, no safety impact

## Documentation
1. Create NCR (Non-Conformance Report) per DATA_38-08-02 template
2. Document with photos, measurements, test data
3. Attach SHA-256 hashes for all evidence
4. Assign NCR number and track in system

## Disposition Options
- **Use As Is:** Acceptable with engineering justification
- **Rework:** Repair to meet specification
- **Return to Supplier:** Supplier responsible for correction
- **Scrap:** Cannot be economically repaired

## Approval Authority
- **Minor:** Engineering approval
- **Major:** Engineering + Quality approval
- **Critical:** Engineering + Quality + Airworthiness approval

## Root Cause Analysis
Required for all Major and Critical NCRs. Document corrective and preventive actions (CAPA).

## Records
All NCR records maintained in DPP with full traceability.
