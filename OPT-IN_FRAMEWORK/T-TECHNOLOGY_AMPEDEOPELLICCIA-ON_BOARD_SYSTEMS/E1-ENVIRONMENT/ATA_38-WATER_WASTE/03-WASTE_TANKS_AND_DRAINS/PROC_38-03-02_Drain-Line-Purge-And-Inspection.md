## Purpose
Purge and inspect waste drain lines to ensure proper flow and prevent blockages.

## Safety
Use PPE including gloves, eye protection, and respiratory protection when handling waste materials.

## Steps
1. Isolate drain system and verify LOTO
2. Flush lines with approved cleaning solution
3. Visual inspection using borescope where accessible
4. Flow test to verify drainage capacity
5. Pressure test for leak detection
6. Record results and attach photographic evidence with SHA-256

## Acceptance Criteria
- No blockages or restrictions
- Flow rate meets design specification
- No leaks at test pressure
- Visual inspection shows no corrosion or damage
