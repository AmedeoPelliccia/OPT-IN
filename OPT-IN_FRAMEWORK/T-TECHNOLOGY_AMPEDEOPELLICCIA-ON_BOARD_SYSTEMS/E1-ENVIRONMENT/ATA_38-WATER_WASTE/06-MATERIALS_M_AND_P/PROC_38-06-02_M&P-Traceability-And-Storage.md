Owner: Environmental Systems Engineering

## Purpose
Ensure materials and processes for water/waste systems maintain full traceability and proper storage.

## Traceability Requirements
1. All materials must have Certificate of Conformance (CoC)
2. NSF certification required for potable water contact materials
3. Lot numbers recorded for all consumables
4. Shelf life tracking mandatory
5. Supplier quality records maintained

## Storage Requirements
- Temperature-controlled environment (15-25°C typical)
- Low humidity (<60% RH)
- No UV exposure for elastomers
- Sealed containers for adhesives and sealants
- FIFO (First In, First Out) inventory management
- Regular shelf life audits

## Documentation
- Material receiving inspection records
- CoC and certifications filed with DPP
- Lot number traceability to installation records
- Storage condition monitoring logs
- Expired material disposal records

## Non-Conformance
Any material exceeding shelf life or stored improperly must be quarantined and dispositioned per PROC_38-08-01.
