- **MAJOR**: Failure conditions that would reduce capability of aircraft or crew to cope with adverse conditions, with significant increase in workload, physical discomfort, or injuries to occupants
- **MINOR**: Failure conditions that would not significantly reduce aircraft safety, with slight increase in crew workload, slight reduction in safety margins or functional capabilities, slight discomfort to occupants
- **NO SAFETY EFFECT**: Failure conditions that do not affect safety

## 6. Next Steps
