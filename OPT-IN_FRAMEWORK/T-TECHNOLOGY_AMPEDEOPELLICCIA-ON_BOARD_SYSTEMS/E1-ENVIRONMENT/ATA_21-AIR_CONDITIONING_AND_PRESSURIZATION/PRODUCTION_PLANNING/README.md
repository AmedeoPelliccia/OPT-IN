## Production Philosophy

### Quality First
- Right first time manufacturing
- Defect prevention over detection
- Continuous improvement

### Supplier Partnership
- Strategic supplier relationships
- Joint development programs
- Quality at the source

### Traceability
- Serialization of critical parts
- Material certifications
- Chain of custody documentation

## First Article Inspection (FAI)

### Purpose
Verify that production parts meet all engineering requirements before full-rate production

### Requirements
- AS9102 compliance (aerospace standard)
- Full dimensional inspection
- Material verification
- Functional testing
- Documentation package

### Process
1. Select first article samples
2. Perform dimensional inspection (100%)
3. Conduct functional tests
4. Collect material certifications
5. Generate FAI report
6. Submit for approval
7. Archive documentation

## PPAP Process

### Elements (per AIAG standards, adapted for aerospace)
1. Design records
2. Engineering change documents
3. Customer engineering approval
4. FMEA
5. Process flow diagrams
6. Process FMEA
7. Control plan
8. Measurement system analysis
9. Dimensional results
10. Material/performance test results
11. Initial process studies
12. Qualified laboratory documentation
13. Appearance approval report (if applicable)
14. Sample product
15. Master sample
16. Checking aids
17. Customer-specific requirements
18. Part submission warrant (PSW)

## Supplier Management

### Supplier Selection
- Technical capability assessment
- Quality system audit (AS9100)
- Financial stability review
- Capacity evaluation
- Delivery performance

### Supplier Development
- Process capability improvement
- Quality system enhancement
- Cost reduction initiatives
- Technology collaboration

### Performance Monitoring
- On-time delivery

### Supplier Audits
- Initial qualification audit
- Annual surveillance audits
- For-cause audits (quality issues)
- Re-qualification as needed

## Quality Assurance

### Inspection Points
- Receiving inspection (incoming parts)
- In-process inspection (assembly)
- Final inspection (completed assemblies)
- Pre-delivery inspection

### Non-Conformance Management
- NCR initiation and documentation
- Root cause analysis
- Corrective action
- Preventive action
- Verification of effectiveness

### Statistical Process Control
- Control charts (X-bar, R, etc.)
- Process capability (Cp, Cpk)
- Trend analysis
- Process improvement

### Calibration Management
- Calibration schedule
- Traceability to NIST
- Out-of-tolerance procedures
- Calibration records

## Documentation and Records

### Quality Records
- Inspection reports
- Test data
- Certifications (material, process)
- Calibration records
- Training records

### Retention
- As required by contract
- Typically 10+ years for aerospace
- Electronic archive with backup

## Tools and Systems

### Quality Management System (QMS)
- ISO 9001 / AS9100 compliant
- Document control
- Change management
- CAPA (Corrective and Preventive Action)

### Inspection Tools
- CMM (Coordinate Measuring Machine)
