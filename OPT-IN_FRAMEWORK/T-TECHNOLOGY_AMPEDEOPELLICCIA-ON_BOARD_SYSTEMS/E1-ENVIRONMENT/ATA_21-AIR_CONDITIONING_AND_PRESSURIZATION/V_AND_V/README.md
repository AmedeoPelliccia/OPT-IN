# ATA 21 - VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION (V&V)

## Purpose

This directory contains all verification and validation artifacts including test plans, test cases, test evidence, and traceability documentation for the Air Conditioning and Pressurization system.

## Contents

### Plans
- Master Test Plan
- System Verification Plan
- Integration Test Plan
- Validation Plan

### Test Cases
Organized by category:
- **Functional Tests**: System startup, normal operations, subsystem functions
- **Performance Tests**: Cooling capacity, pressurization rate, response times
- **Environmental Tests**: Hot day, cold day, humidity, altitude
- **Integration Tests**: Interfaces with other systems

### Evidence
- Test reports and results
- Certification data packages
- Compliance matrices
- Photographic/video evidence

### Trace
- Requirements-to-test traceability matrix
- Test coverage analysis
- Verification status tracking

## V&V Process

### Verification
**Definition**: "Are we building the product right?"
- Confirms system meets requirements
- Methods: Test, Analysis, Inspection, Demonstration

### Validation
**Definition**: "Are we building the right product?"
- Confirms system meets user needs
- Methods: Operational testing, user acceptance

### V&V Levels
1. **Component Level**: Individual LRUs and parts
2. **Subsystem Level**: Integrated subsystems
3. **System Level**: Complete ATA-21 system
4. **Aircraft Level**: Integration with aircraft

## Test Types

### Functional Testing
- Verify each system function operates as specified
- Normal and abnormal conditions
- Mode transitions
- Fault detection and isolation

### Performance Testing
- Cooling and heating capacity
- Pressurization rate control
- Temperature control accuracy
- Response times

### Environmental Testing (per DO-160)
- Temperature extremes
- Altitude simulation
- Humidity
- Vibration and shock
- EMI/EMC

### Integration Testing
- Interface verification
- System-to-system interaction
- Data communication
- Power coordination

### Safety Testing
- Failure mode verification
- Emergency procedures
- Warning and caution systems
- Redundancy validation

## Test Facilities

### Ground Test Rigs
- Component test benches
- System integration rig (iron bird)
- Environmental chambers
- Pressure chambers

### Flight Test
- Aircraft instrumentation
- Data acquisition systems
- Test procedures
- Flight test plan

## Test Tools and Automation

### Test Execution
- Automated test scripts
- Test data generators
- Result logging

### Analysis
- Data processing tools
- Statistical analysis
- Performance calculators

### Reporting
- Evidence collectors
- Report generators
- Compliance checkers

## Certification Testing

### FAA/EASA Requirements
- Compliance demonstration per certification basis
- DO-160 environmental qualification
- System safety verification
- Means of compliance validation

### Test Documentation
- Test plans (approved by authority)
- Test procedures
- Test reports
- Certification data packages

## Traceability

Requirements → Design → Test → Compliance

Each requirement must have:
- Verification method identified
- Test case(s) defined
- Test evidence collected
- Compliance demonstrated
