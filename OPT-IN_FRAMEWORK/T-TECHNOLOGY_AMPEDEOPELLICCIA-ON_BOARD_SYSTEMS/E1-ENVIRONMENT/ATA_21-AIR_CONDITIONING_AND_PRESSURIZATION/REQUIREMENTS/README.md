# ATA 21 - REQUIREMENTS

## Purpose

This directory contains system requirements, derived requirements, regulatory mappings, and requirements traceability for the Air Conditioning and Pressurization system.

## Contents

### Requirements Documents

- **21-00-00_ALR.md** - Airworthiness Limitation Requirements
- **21-00-00_SR.md** - System Requirements (top-level)
- **21-00-00_SSR.md** - Subsystem Requirements
- **21-00-00_CR.md** - Component Requirements
- **21-00-00_RTM.xlsx** - Requirements Traceability Matrix
- **21-00-00_REGULATORY_MAPPING.md** - Mapping to FAR/CS-25 requirements
- **21-00-00_DERIVED_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Requirements derived from design choices

### Requirements Tools

Located in `scripts/`:
- **requirements_parser.py** - Parse and validate requirements
- **rtm_validator.py** - Validate traceability matrix completeness
- **compliance_checker.py** - Check regulatory compliance coverage

## Requirements Hierarchy

## Key Attributes

Each requirement includes:
- **Requirement ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., SYS-21-0001)
- **Title**: Short descriptive title
- **Description**: Complete requirement statement
- **Rationale**: Why this requirement exists
- **Verification Method**: Test, Analysis, Inspection, or Demonstration
- **Traceability**: Parent and child requirements
- **Status**: Draft, Approved, Verified, Validated
- **Priority**: Critical, High, Medium, Low

## Requirements Types

### Functional Requirements
Define what the system must do

### Performance Requirements
Define how well the system must perform

### Interface Requirements
Define interactions with other systems

### Safety Requirements
Define safety-critical functions and constraints

### Certification Requirements
Define what must be demonstrated to certify

### Maintainability Requirements
Define maintenance and serviceability needs

## Verification Methods

- **Test (T)**: Physical testing to demonstrate compliance
- **Analysis (A)**: Engineering analysis or simulation
- **Inspection (I)**: Visual or measurement verification
- **Demonstration (D)**: Operational demonstration

## Traceability

The Requirements Traceability Matrix (RTM) ensures:
- Every regulatory requirement is addressed
- Every system requirement traces to a regulatory requirement
- Every subsystem requirement traces to system requirements
- Every design element traces to requirements
- Every test traces to requirements

## Tools and Automation

### Requirements Parser
Extracts and validates requirements from documents

### RTM Validator
Ensures completeness of traceability links

### Compliance Checker
Verifies all regulatory requirements have means of compliance
