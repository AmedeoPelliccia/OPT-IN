# 02-10_SMOKE_DETECTORS

**Parent System:** 02-DETECTION_AND_SENSING  
**Subsystem:** Smoke Detectors

## Overview

This subsystem covers photoelectric and ionization smoke detectors used throughout the aircraft for early fire detection in cabin, cargo, lavatories, and equipment bays.

## Detector Types

### Photoelectric Smoke Detectors
- Light scattering principle
- Sensitive to smoldering fires
- Lower false alarm rate
- Used in cabin, cargo, equipment bays

### Ionization Smoke Detectors
- Ionization chamber principle
- Sensitive to fast-flaming fires
- Quick response time
- Used in lavatories, high-risk areas

### Dual-Sensor Detectors
- Combined photoelectric and ionization
- Detects both smoldering and flaming fires
- Enhanced reliability
- Used in critical areas

## Key Documents

To be populated with:
- Detector specifications and part numbers
