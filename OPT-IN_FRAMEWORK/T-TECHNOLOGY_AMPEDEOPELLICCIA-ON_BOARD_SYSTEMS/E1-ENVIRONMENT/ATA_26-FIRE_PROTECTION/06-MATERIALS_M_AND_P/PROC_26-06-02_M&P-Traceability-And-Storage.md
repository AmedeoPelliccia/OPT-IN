## Receiving and Inspection

### 1. Material Receipt

Upon receipt of fire protection materials:

1. Verify shipment documentation against purchase order
2. Inspect packaging for damage or tampering
3. Check material identification markings
4. Verify quantity received

### 2. Certificate of Conformance (CoC)

All materials must be accompanied by a valid Certificate of Conformance:

- **Required information:**
  - Manufacturer name and facility
  - Material specification or part number
  - Batch/lot number
  - Manufacturing date
  - Expiration date (if applicable)
  - Test results (as applicable)
  - Authorized signature

- **CoC retention:** Maintain CoC in Digital Product Passport (DPP) system and physical archive for aircraft lifetime

### 3. Inspection Criteria

#### Fire Extinguishing Agents
- Verify agent type matches specification
- Check container seals are intact
- Verify batch/lot number on container
- Confirm purity specifications (if test data provided)
- Check expiration date

#### Fire Bottles/Containers
- Inspect for dents, corrosion, or damage
- Verify hydrostatic test date and next due date
- Check pressure relief device condition
- Verify serial number and data plate legibility

#### Detection Components
- Verify part number and serial number
- Check for physical damage
- Verify calibration date (if applicable)
- Inspect connectors and terminations

### 4. Accept/Reject Criteria

**Accept if:**
- All documentation is complete and valid
- Material meets specification requirements
- No visible damage or defects
- Within shelf life or service life limits

**Reject if:**
- Missing or invalid CoC
- Material does not meet specification
- Visible damage or contamination
- Expired or beyond service limits
- Suspect unapproved parts (SUP)

## Storage Requirements

### Fire Extinguishing Agents

**Halon 1301, HFC-125, FK-5-1-12:**
- Store in original sealed containers
- Temperature range: 40°F to 120°F
- Avoid direct sunlight
- Segregate from incompatible materials
- Maintain container upright position
- Mark storage location with batch/lot number

**Shelf Life:**
- Halon 1301: Indefinite (if properly stored)
- HFC-125: Indefinite (if properly stored)
- FK-5-1-12: Indefinite (if properly stored)

**Note:** Verify agent purity before use if stored >5 years

### Fire Bottles/Containers

- Store in clean, dry environment
- Temperature range: 40°F to 120°F
- Support containers to prevent rolling
- Protect from impact or dropping
- Mark with hydrostatic test due date
- Segregate charged vs. uncharged containers

### Detection Components

- Store in original packaging until installation
- Temperature range: -40°F to 160°F
- Humidity: <85% RH
- Protect from electrostatic discharge (ESD)
- Maintain calibration seals intact

## Traceability

### 1. Material Tracking

All fire protection materials must be tracked from receipt through installation and service life:

**Required data:**
- Receiving date and receiving inspector
- Material identification (P/N, specification)
- Batch/lot number or serial number
- Manufacturer and CoC number
- Storage location
- Issue date and work order
- Aircraft MSN and installation location
- Removal date and reason (when applicable)

### 2. Digital Product Passport (DPP)

Enter the following information into DPP system:

- Material receipt record
- CoC document (scanned)
- Storage location and conditions
- Issue and installation records
- Service history (tests, inspections, repairs)
- Removal and disposition

### 3. Batch/Lot Traceability

For fire extinguishing agents:
- Maintain batch/lot number through entire lifecycle
- Record batch number on installation records
- Enable recall capability by batch/lot
- Track batch expiration or retest dates

### 4. Serial Number Traceability

For serialized components (bottles, detectors, control units):
- Record serial number on all maintenance actions
- Link serial number to aircraft MSN
- Track service history by serial number
- Maintain records for component lifetime

## Material Handling

### Fire Extinguishing Agents

**Safety precautions:**
- Avoid inhalation of agent vapors
- Use in well-ventilated areas
- Avoid skin and eye contact
- Do not heat containers above 120°F
- Use appropriate PPE (gloves, safety glasses)

**Handling:**
- Do not drop or impact containers
- Use proper lifting equipment for heavy bottles
- Avoid contamination during transfer operations
- Use clean, dedicated transfer equipment

### Pressurized Containers

- Never exceed maximum fill pressure
- Verify pressure rating before charging
- Use proper pressure regulators
- Implement safety shields during charging
- Follow lockout/tagout procedures

## Quality Assurance

### Periodic Storage Inspections

Conduct storage area inspections every 90 days:
- Verify storage conditions maintained
- Check for container damage or leakage
- Verify shelf life/expiration dates
- Confirm traceability markings present
- Review storage records for completeness

### Audit Trail

Maintain complete audit trail:
- Material movement logs
- Storage condition monitoring records
- Periodic inspection reports
- Non-conformance reports (if any)
- CoC and test certificate archives

## Responsibilities

- **Receiving Inspector:** Material receipt, inspection, and acceptance
- **Materials Manager:** Storage, inventory, and issue control
- **Quality Assurance:** CoC verification, periodic audits, DPP entries
- **Engineering:** Material specification, approval, and disposition authority

## Records

Retain the following records:
- Receiving inspection reports: Aircraft lifetime
- Certificates of Conformance: Aircraft lifetime
- Storage inspection logs: 3 years
- Material issue records: Aircraft lifetime
- DPP entries: Aircraft lifetime
