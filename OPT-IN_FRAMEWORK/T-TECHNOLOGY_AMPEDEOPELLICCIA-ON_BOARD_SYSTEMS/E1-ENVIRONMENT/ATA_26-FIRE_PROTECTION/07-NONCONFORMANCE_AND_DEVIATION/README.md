# 07-NONCONFORMANCE_AND_DEVIATION - NCR and Deviation Management

**Parent Chapter:** ATA 26 - Fire Protection  
**Section:** Non-conformance and Deviation Management

## Purpose

This section provides procedures and templates for handling non-conformances, deviations, and engineering dispositions related to fire protection systems.

## Key Documents

### PROC_26-07-01_Nonconformance-Handling-And-Engineering-Disposition.md
Comprehensive procedure covering:
- NCR initiation and reporting
- Severity classification (minor, major, critical, safety-of-flight)
- Investigation and root cause analysis
- Engineering disposition options:
  - Use as-is (with justification)
  - Rework to specification
  - Repair (with approved procedure)
  - Scrap/reject
  - Return to supplier
- Approval workflows
- Corrective and preventive actions (CAPA)
- Closure and verification

### DATA_26-07-02_NCR-Template.csv
Standardized NCR template including:
- NCR number and status tracking
- System/component identification
- Discrepancy description
- Discovery phase and method
- Root cause analysis
- Disposition and rationale
- Corrective actions
- Preventive measures
- Closure verification

### PROC_Root-Cause-Analysis.md
Procedures for conducting root cause analysis:
- 5 Whys method
- Fishbone (Ishikawa) diagrams
- Fault tree analysis
- Failure modes and effects analysis
- Contributing factors identification
- Documentation requirements

## NCR Workflow

1. **Discovery** - Non-conformance identified
2. **Reporting** - NCR opened with description
3. **Investigation** - Root cause analysis
4. **Disposition** - Engineering evaluation and decision
5. **Approval** - Management and authorities sign-off
6. **Implementation** - Corrective actions executed
7. **Verification** - Effectiveness verified
8. **Closure** - NCR closed with lessons learned

## Severity Classification

### Minor
- No safety impact
- Does not affect airworthiness
- Cosmetic or documentation issues

### Major
- Potential safety impact
- May affect system performance
- Requires engineering evaluation

### Critical
- Direct safety impact
- Affects flight safety
- Immediate action required

### Safety-of-Flight
- Immediate hazard to aircraft or occupants
- Requires immediate grounding or restriction
- Mandatory regulatory reporting
