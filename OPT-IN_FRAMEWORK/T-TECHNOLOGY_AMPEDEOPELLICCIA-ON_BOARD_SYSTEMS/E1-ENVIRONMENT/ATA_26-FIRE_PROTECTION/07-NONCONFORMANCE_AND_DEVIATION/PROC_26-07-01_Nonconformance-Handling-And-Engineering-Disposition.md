# PROC_26-07-01_Nonconformance-Handling-And-Engineering-Disposition

**Document ID:** PROC_26-07-01  
**Title:** Nonconformance Handling and Engineering Disposition  
**ATA Chapter:** 26-07  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Status:** Released

## Purpose

This procedure establishes requirements for identifying, documenting, evaluating, and dispositioning non-conformances in fire protection systems.

## Scope

Applies to all non-conformances discovered in ATA-26 fire protection systems during manufacturing, installation, testing, maintenance, or service.

## Definitions

**Non-conformance (NC):** Any deviation from approved specifications, drawings, procedures, or regulatory requirements.

**Non-conformance Report (NCR):** Formal documentation of a non-conformance including description, evaluation, disposition, and corrective action.

**Disposition:** Engineering decision on how to handle the non-conforming item (use-as-is, rework, repair, scrap, return).

## NCR Initiation

### 1. When to Initiate NCR

Open an NCR when:
- Part or material does not meet specification
- Installation does not match drawing or procedure
- Test result is out of specification limits
- Damage or defect discovered during inspection
- Unauthorized modification or repair found
- Missing or invalid documentation

### 2. NCR Numbering

NCR numbers follow pattern: `NCR-26-YYYYNNNN`
- 26 = ATA chapter
- YYYY = Year
- NNNN = Sequential number

Example: NCR-26-20250001

### 3. NCR Information Required

- **System/Component:** ATA reference, P/N, S/N, location
- **Discovery:** When, where, how, by whom
- **Description:** Clear description of non-conformance
- **Extent:** Single unit, batch, fleet-wide
- **Severity:** Minor, Major, Critical, Safety-of-Flight
- **Immediate Actions:** Safety measures taken

## Severity Classification

### Minor
- No impact on safety or airworthiness
- Cosmetic or documentation issues
- Easily correctable
- **Example:** Missing label, incorrect torque seal color

### Major
- Potential impact on system performance
- May affect airworthiness if not corrected
- Requires engineering evaluation
- **Example:** Fire bottle pressure below minimum, detector mounting loose

### Critical
- Direct impact on fire protection capability
- Affects airworthiness
- May require aircraft grounding
- **Example:** Detection loop damaged, fire bottle empty, suppression system inoperative

### Safety-of-Flight
- Immediate hazard to aircraft safety
- Requires immediate action
- Mandatory regulatory reporting
- **Example:** Fire detection system failure, inadvertent agent discharge, fire bottle explosion risk

## Investigation and Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Investigation

Conduct investigation to determine:
- Root cause of non-conformance
- Contributing factors
- Extent of impact (single unit vs. fleet)
- Similar issues on other aircraft
- Process or design deficiency

### 2. Root Cause Analysis Methods

Use appropriate method based on severity:
- **5 Whys:** Simple issues, minor NCs
- **Fishbone Diagram:** Multiple contributing factors
- **Fault Tree Analysis:** Complex systems, critical NCs
- **FMEA:** Design or process deficiencies

### 3. Documentation

Document investigation findings:
- Root cause statement
- Contributing factors
- Evidence and data
- Extent of condition assessment
- Similar occurrences

## Engineering Disposition

### Disposition Options

#### Use-As-Is
- Non-conformance does not affect form, fit, function, or safety
- Requires engineering justification
- May require authority approval
- **Example:** Dimension slightly out of tolerance but within design margin

#### Rework
- Bring item into full conformance with specification
- No deviation or concession required
- Follow standard procedures
- **Example:** Re-torque fasteners, re-route wire bundle

#### Repair
- Restore item to serviceable condition
- May not meet original specification
- Requires approved repair procedure
- Requires engineering approval and data update
- **Example:** Blend out dent in fire bottle, repair chafed wire

#### Scrap
- Item cannot be economically repaired
- Safety concerns prevent use
- Dispose per hazardous material procedures
- **Example:** Cracked fire bottle, contaminated agent

#### Return to Supplier
- Supplier-caused defect
- Supplier responsible for correction
- Document for supplier corrective action
- **Example:** Wrong part shipped, defective detector

#### Deviation/Concession
- Temporary acceptance of non-conformance
- Limited scope and duration
- Requires authority approval
- Must include expiration or correction plan

### Disposition Approval Authority

| Severity | Approval Required |
|----------|-------------------|
| Minor | Quality Manager |
| Major | Engineering Manager + Quality |
| Critical | Chief Engineer + Airworthiness |
| Safety-of-Flight | Chief Engineer + Airworthiness + Authority |

## Corrective and Preventive Actions

### Corrective Actions (Fix the Problem)

Address immediate non-conformance:
- Implement disposition decision
- Verify effectiveness
- Update affected aircraft (if fleet impact)
- Update documentation

### Preventive Actions (Prevent Recurrence)

Prevent similar issues in the future:
- Process improvements
- Design changes
- Training updates
- Supplier quality improvements
- Procedure revisions

### CAPA Tracking

Track corrective and preventive actions:
- Action description and responsible party
- Target completion date
- Status (open, in-progress, completed, verified)
- Effectiveness verification method
- Closure signature and date

## Regulatory Reporting

### FAA Reporting Requirements

Report if non-conformance involves:
- Failure or malfunction of fire protection system
- Unsafe condition that could result in fire
- Any condition that could result in injury or death
- Unapproved parts or materials

### Reporting Timeframe

- **Immediate (24 hours):** Safety-of-flight issues
- **Within 5 days:** Critical defects, unsafe conditions
- **Per regulation:** Other reportable items

### Reporting Method

- FAA Form 8010-4 (Malfunction or Defect Report)
- Service Difficulty Report (SDR)
- As directed by authority

## NCR Closure

### Closure Criteria

NCR may be closed when:
1. Disposition implemented and verified
2. Corrective actions completed
3. Preventive actions in place
4. Effectiveness verified
5. All approvals obtained
6. Documentation updated
7. Lessons learned documented

### Closure Verification

- Independent verification of disposition
- Review by Quality Assurance
- Approval by responsible engineer
- Final sign-off by NCR originator (if possible)

### Closure Documentation

- Disposition verification report
- Corrective action completion evidence
- Preventive action implementation evidence
- Updated drawings, procedures, specifications
- Lessons learned summary

## Records and Retention

Maintain NCR records including:
- Original NCR form
- Investigation report and root cause analysis
- Engineering disposition and approvals
- Corrective/preventive action records
- Verification and test results
- Regulatory correspondence (if applicable)
- Closure documentation

**Retention:** Aircraft lifetime for all NCRs affecting airworthiness

## Responsibilities

- **Originator:** Identify and document non-conformance
- **Quality:** NCR processing, tracking, verification
- **Engineering:** Investigation, disposition, approval
- **Airworthiness:** Certification impact, authority coordination
- **Production/Maintenance:** Implement disposition and corrective actions
