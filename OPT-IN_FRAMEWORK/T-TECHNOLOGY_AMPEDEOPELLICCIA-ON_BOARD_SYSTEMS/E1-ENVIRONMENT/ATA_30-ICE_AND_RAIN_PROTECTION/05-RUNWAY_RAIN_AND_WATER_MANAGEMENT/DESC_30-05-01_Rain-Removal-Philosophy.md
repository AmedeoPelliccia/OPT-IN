# DESC_30-05-01 â€” Rain Removal Philosophy
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Ice & Rain Engineering

## Purpose

Define the rain removal philosophy, system architecture, and operational modes for windshield rain removal on the AMPEL360 BWB aircraft.

## Rain Removal Systems

The AMPEL360 BWB employs a multi-layered approach to rain removal:

### 1. Windshield Wipers
- **Type:** Electric motor-driven wipers with variable speed control
- **Operational modes:** Intermittent, low speed, high speed
- **Coverage:** Minimum 80% of pilot's forward field of view
- **Qualification:** Per DO-160 environmental testing

### 2. Rain Repellent Coating
- **Type:** Hydrophobic coating applied to windshield outer surface
- **Application:** During windshield installation or per maintenance schedule
- **Effectiveness:** Reduces water adhesion, improves visibility at high speed
- **Reapplication:** Every 500 flight hours or as needed based on visual inspection

### 3. Windshield Heating
- **Function:** Prevent ice formation, improve rain removal effectiveness
- **Integration:** Coordinated with wiper operation
- **Control:** Automatic activation in icing conditions

### 4. Bleed Air (if applicable)
- **Function:** Provide high-velocity air stream across windshield
- **Operational altitude:** Below 10,000 ft typically
- **Qualification:** Noise and thermal effects validated

## Operational Philosophy

- **Primary:** Windshield wipers for direct rain removal
- **Secondary:** Rain repellent coating to enhance visibility between wiper cycles
- **Tertiary:** Windshield heating to prevent ice accumulation
- **Contingency:** Pilot can adjust wiper speed and use alternate windshield if available

## Maintenance Philosophy

- Regular inspection of wiper blades for wear and damage
- Periodic reapplication of rain repellent coating
- Functional testing of wiper motor and control system
- Visual inspection of windshield for scratches, cracks, or coating degradation
