# PROC_30-02-02 — Deice Boot Installation and Removal
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Ice & Rain Engineering

## Safety

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** Chemical hazards from adhesives, primers, and solvents. Ensure adequate ventilation. Use respiratory protection when working with MEK, primers, or adhesive systems. Follow all SDS requirements.

**Hazards:**
- Chemical exposure (adhesives, solvents, primers)
- Ergonomic hazards during large boot installation
- Surface preparation dust and particles
- Foreign object debris (FOD) in leading edge

## Purpose

Remove damaged or end-of-life de-ice boots and install new boots with proper surface preparation, adhesive application, and cure cycle control.

## Applicability

All pneumatic de-ice boots on AMPEL360 BWB aircraft requiring removal and replacement.

## Tools and Materials

- Boot removal tools (heat gun, plastic scrapers, approved solvents)
- Surface preparation tools (abrasive pads, Scotch-Brite, orbital sander if approved)
- Approved adhesive system (see DATA_30-06-01)
- Adhesive application tools (roller, brush, spatula)
- Replacement boot (with CofC and traceability documentation)
- Primer (if required by adhesive system)
- Temperature monitoring equipment (thermocouples, IR thermometer)
- Pressure application system (vacuum bag or roller)
- PPE (respirator, chemical-resistant gloves, safety glasses)

## Procedure (Summary)

### 1. Boot Removal
1.1. De-energize and tag pneumatic system
1.2. Document existing boot condition with photographs
1.3. Apply heat (max 80°C) to soften adhesive
1.4. Carefully peel boot from leading edge using plastic scrapers
1.5. Remove all residual adhesive using approved solvent
1.6. Inspect substrate for damage, corrosion, or anomalies

### 2. Surface Preparation
2.1. Clean surface with solvent (MEK or approved)
2.2. Abrade surface per adhesive manufacturer specification (Scotch-Brite pad or equivalent)
2.3. Ensure surface is clean, dry, and free of contamination
2.4. Apply primer if required (follow primer cure schedule)
2.5. Surface must be prepared within 4 hours of adhesive application (or per adhesive spec)

### 3. Adhesive Application
3.1. Verify adhesive lot number and CofC
3.2. Mix adhesive per manufacturer instructions (if two-part)
3.3. Apply adhesive to substrate in uniform layer (typical thickness 0.5-1.0 mm)
3.4. Apply adhesive to boot backing surface if required
3.5. Monitor pot life and ensure application within working time

### 4. Boot Installation
4.1. Position boot on leading edge, align with reference marks
4.2. Apply pressure using roller or vacuum bag (typical 0.5-1.0 bar)
4.3. Remove entrapped air bubbles by rolling from center outward
4.4. Secure boot edges and pneumatic port connection
4.5. Apply cure temperature and pressure per adhesive specification

### 5. Cure Cycle
5.1. Maintain cure temperature (typical 20-25°C ambient, or elevated if specified)
5.2. Maintain pressure during cure (typically 24-48 hours minimum)
5.3. Monitor temperature with thermocouples if elevated cure used
5.4. Do not disturb boot during cure period

### 6. Post-Installation Inspection
6.1. Visual inspection for voids, wrinkles, edge lifting
6.2. Ultrasonic bond inspection (if equipment available)
6.3. Inflation pressure hold test per PROC_30-02-01
6.4. Functional cycle test (50 cycles minimum)

### 7. Documentation
7.1. Record boot part number, serial number, installation date
7.2. Record adhesive lot number, CofC reference, cure cycle parameters
7.3. Update Digital Product Passport (ATA-95)
7.4. Update aircraft maintenance logbook
7.5. Attach all NDT reports and test results with SHA-256 hashes
