# PROC_30-06-02 â€” M&P Traceability and Storage
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Materials & Process Engineering

## Purpose

Define material traceability requirements, storage conditions, shelf life management, and Certificate of Conformance (CofC) verification procedures for all ice and rain protection system materials.

## Scope

All materials used in ice and rain protection systems including adhesives, sealants, boot materials, fabrics, lubricants, primers, and coatings.

## Material Receipt and Verification

1. **Receipt Inspection:**
   - Verify part number matches purchase order
   - Check lot/batch number and manufacturing date
   - Inspect packaging for damage
   - Verify Certificate of Conformance (CofC) is included

2. **CofC Verification:**
   - Verify CofC includes: part number, lot/batch, manufacturing date, expiration date, test results, authorized signature
   - Scan and archive CofC with SHA-256 hash
   - Link CofC to material tracking database

3. **Storage Assignment:**
   - Assign storage location per environmental requirements (temperature, humidity)
   - Label material with receipt date and expiration date
   - Enter material into inventory tracking system

## Storage Requirements

- **Temperature-Controlled Storage:** Adhesives, sealants, primers per DATA_30-06-01
- **Humidity-Controlled Storage:** Boot materials, fabrics per DATA_30-06-01
- **Shelf Life Monitoring:** Monthly inspection of expiration dates, rotate stock (FIFO)
- **Segregation:** Separate approved materials from rejected or expired materials

## Material Issue and Traceability

1. **Issue Process:**
   - Verify material is within shelf life
   - Record issue date, quantity, work order, technician ID
   - Document lot/batch number on work order and repair record

2. **Usage Documentation:**
   - Record material lot/batch used in repair record
   - Link to CofC reference
   - Update Digital Product Passport (ATA-95) with material traceability

3. **Unused Material Return:**
   - Re-inspect for contamination or damage
   - Update remaining quantity in inventory
   - Verify storage conditions maintained

## Expired or Rejected Material Disposition

- Clearly mark as "EXPIRED" or "REJECTED - DO NOT USE"
- Segregate from approved materials
- Dispose per environmental regulations and company procedures
- Document disposition in tracking system

## Training Required

- Materials & Process Procedures
- Quality Control and Inspection

## References

- DATA_30-06-01: Approved Seals, Lubricants, and Fabrics
- ATA-20: Standard Practices - Airframe
- ATA-95: Digital Product Passport
