Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Ice & Rain Engineering

## Purpose

This document defines the scope, governance structure, effectivity, and regulatory basis for ATA 30 Ice and Rain Protection systems in the AMPEL360 BWB aircraft.

## Scope

The ATA 30 chapter encompasses all systems and procedures related to ice and rain protection, including:

1. **De-ice Systems:** Pneumatic de-ice boots, electrothermal leading edge heating
2. **Anti-ice Systems:** Hot air/bleed air distribution, electrothermal windshield and sensor heating
3. **Rain Removal:** Windshield wipers, rain repellent systems, water management
4. **Ice Detection:** Ice detection sensors and crew alerting
5. **Control Systems:** Ice protection control panels, automatic sequencing, fault monitoring

## Governance

**Owner:** Ice & Rain Engineering / Environmental Systems
**Review Board:** Airworthiness Engineering, Materials & Process Engineering, NDT Engineering, Aerodynamics Engineering

All procedures, limits, and material specifications within this chapter are mandatory unless explicitly noted otherwise. Any deviation requires engineering disposition and airworthiness approval.

## Effectivity

**Aircraft Type:** AMPEL360 BWB
**MSN Range:** ALL
**Configuration:** All configurations unless otherwise specified in individual documents

## Regulatory Basis

This chapter complies with the following regulations and standards:
- FAA Part 25.1419 (Ice Protection)
- FAA Part 25.1093 (Induction System Icing Protection)
- EASA CS-25 equivalent regulations
- SAE ARP5905 (Ice Protection System Design)
- DO-160 (Environmental Conditions and Test Procedures)
- ARP4754A (Development of Civil Aircraft Systems)
- ARP4761 (Safety Assessment Process)

## Document Structure

All documents within this chapter follow the naming convention:
- **DESC:** Descriptive documents (system descriptions, philosophies)
- **PROC:** Procedures (maintenance, repair, test, inspection)
- **DATA:** Data tables (limits, specifications, acceptance criteria)
- **TESTPLAN:** Qualification and validation test plans
- **EXAMPLE:** Example records and reports

Each document must have a corresponding `.meta.yaml` sidecar file containing metadata, traceability, and integrity information.
