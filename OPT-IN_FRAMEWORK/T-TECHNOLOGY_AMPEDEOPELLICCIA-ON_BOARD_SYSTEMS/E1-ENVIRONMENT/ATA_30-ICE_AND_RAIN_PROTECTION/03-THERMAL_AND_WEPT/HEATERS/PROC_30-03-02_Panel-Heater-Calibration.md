# PROC_30-03-02 — Panel Heater Calibration
Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Ice & Rain Engineering

## Purpose

Calibrate thermal control units and verify heater panel temperature accuracy using reference temperature sensors and data acquisition systems.

## Applicability

All electrothermal panel heaters and control units requiring periodic calibration per maintenance schedule.

## Tools and Equipment

- Calibrated reference thermocouple or RTD (NIST-traceable)
- Thermal imaging camera (optional)
- Thermocouple simulator (for control unit calibration)
- Data acquisition system
- Control unit test bench

## Acceptance Criteria

- Temperature sensor accuracy: ±1°C at calibration points
- Control unit setpoint accuracy: ±2°C
- Calibration frequency: Every 12 months or 3,000 flight hours

## Procedure (Summary)

1. Remove control unit or access temperature sensors
2. Connect calibrated reference sensor in parallel with system sensor
3. Apply known temperatures at calibration points (0°C, 50°C, 100°C, 150°C)
4. Compare system reading to reference sensor
5. Adjust calibration coefficients in control unit (if adjustable)
6. Document calibration data with certificate reference
7. Update calibration records in DPP

## Training Required

- Electrical Systems Calibration
- Ice & Rain Protection Systems Level 2
