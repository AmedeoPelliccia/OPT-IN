# Aircraft Level Requirements (ALR)

## Document Information
- **ATA Chapter**: 72-00 ENGINE
- **Document Type**: Aircraft Level Requirements
- **Revision**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-31

## Purpose
This document defines the top-level requirements for the 72-00 system derived from aircraft-level operational, performance, and safety needs.

## Requirement Categories

### Performance Requirements
Requirements for thrust, response time, fuel efficiency, and operational capabilities that ensure the aircraft meets its mission profile.

### Safety Requirements
Requirements derived from safety assessments (FHA/PSSA) including failure probability targets, redundancy, and monitoring capabilities.

### Environmental Requirements
Requirements for operation across the full environmental envelope including temperature, altitude, weather, and external threats.

### Reliability and Maintainability Requirements
Requirements for in-service reliability (IFSD rates, dispatch reliability) and maintainability (TBO, maintenance concept).

### Interface Requirements
Requirements for interfaces with other aircraft systems (electrical, fuel, bleed air, control, data).

### Certification Requirements
Requirements to meet regulatory standards (FAR 33, FAR 25, emissions, noise).

### Operational Requirements
Requirements for extended operations (ETOPS), continuous operation capability, and operational modes.

## Requirements Traceability
Each requirement traces to:
- Source regulation or standard
- System-level requirements (SR)
- Verification method
- Verification status

## Approval
Approved by Chief Engineer, Safety Manager, Certification Manager, and Program Manager.
