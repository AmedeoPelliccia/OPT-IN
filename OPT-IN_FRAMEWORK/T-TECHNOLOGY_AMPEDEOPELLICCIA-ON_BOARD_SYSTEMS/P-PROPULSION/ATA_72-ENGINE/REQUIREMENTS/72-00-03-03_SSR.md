# System Requirements (SR)

## Document Information
- **ATA Chapter**: 72-00 ENGINE
- **Document Type**: System Requirements
- **Revision**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-31

## Purpose
This document defines the system-level requirements for 72-00 that flow down from Aircraft Level Requirements (ALR) and decompose into subsystem and component requirements.

## Requirement Structure

### Functional Requirements
What the system shall do - core functions and capabilities.

### Performance Requirements
Quantitative specifications for system performance parameters.

### Interface Requirements
Requirements for interfaces with other systems and subsystems.

### Safety Requirements
Safety-related requirements derived from FHA and PSSA.

### Design Requirements
Constraints on design choices including standards compliance, technology selection, and design principles.

### Verification Requirements
How each requirement will be verified (test, analysis, inspection, demonstration).

## Traceability
- **Up**: Traces to Aircraft Level Requirements (ALR)
- **Down**: Decomposes into Subsystem Requirements (SSR) and Component Requirements (CR)
- **Across**: References to interface specifications, safety assessments, and design documents

## Requirements Management
Requirements are managed in a requirements management tool with change control, impact analysis, and approval workflow.

## Approval
Approved by System Engineer, Chief Engineer, and Program Manager.
