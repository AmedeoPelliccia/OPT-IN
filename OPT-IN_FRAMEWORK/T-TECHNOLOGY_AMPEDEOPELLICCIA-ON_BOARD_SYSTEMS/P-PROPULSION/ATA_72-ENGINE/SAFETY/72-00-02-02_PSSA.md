# Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA)

## Document Information
- **ATA Chapter**: 72-00 ENGINE
- **Document Type**: Preliminary System Safety Assessment
- **Compliance**: ARP4761, FAR 25.1309, FAR 33
- **Revision**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-31

## Purpose
The Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA) allocates failure condition probabilities from the FHA to specific system architectures and validates that the proposed design can meet safety requirements.

## Scope
This PSSA evaluates the 72-00 subsystem architecture, redundancy, independence, and failure probability allocations.

## System Architecture Overview

### Primary Components
- Control systems with redundancy
- Monitoring and sensing systems
- Actuation and power systems
- Safety-critical hardware and software

### Safety Architecture Principles

**Independence**: Physical and functional separation of critical paths
**Redundancy**: Backup capability for critical functions
**Monitoring**: Continuous health assessment with fault detection
**Fail-Safe Design**: No single failure leads to catastrophic condition

## Failure Probability Allocations

### Catastrophic Conditions (< 10⁻⁹ per FH)
Specific allocations based on system architecture and common cause analysis.

### Hazardous Conditions (< 10⁻⁷ per FH)
Control system failures, fire detection failures, structural failures.

### Major Conditions (< 10⁻⁵ per FH)
Single component failures with degraded capability but safe operation.

## Design Assurance Levels (DAL)

Software and hardware components are assigned DAL based on failure effect severity:
- **Level A**: Catastrophic failure effect
- **Level B**: Hazardous failure effect
- **Level C**: Major failure effect
- **Level D**: Minor failure effect

## Common Cause Analysis

### Identified Common Causes
1. Environmental (icing, lightning, volcanic ash)
2. Operational (maintenance errors, contamination)
3. Design (common parts, shared systems)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Dissimilar redundancy where practical
- Environmental protection
- Physical separation and segregation
- Independent verification and validation

## Derived Safety Requirements
1. Redundancy requirements for critical functions
2. Monitoring and Built-In Test (BIT) coverage
3. Failure detection and isolation capabilities
4. Design assurance level assignments
5. Common cause prevention measures

## Compliance Verification Methods
- Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)
- Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA)
- Common Cause Analysis (CCA)
- Testing and validation programs

## Next Steps
1. Complete detailed system design
2. Conduct System Safety Assessment (SSA)
3. Perform detailed FMEA
4. Validate failure rate allocations
5. Update safety case with test evidence
