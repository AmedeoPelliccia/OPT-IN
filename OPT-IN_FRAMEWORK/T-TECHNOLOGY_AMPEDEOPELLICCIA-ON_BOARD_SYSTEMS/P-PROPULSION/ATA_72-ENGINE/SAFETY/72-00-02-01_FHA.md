# Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA)

## Document Information
- **ATA Chapter**: 72-00 ENGINE
- **Document Type**: Functional Hazard Assessment
- **Compliance**: ARP4761, FAR 25.1309
- **Revision**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-31

## Purpose
This Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA) identifies and classifies the failure conditions associated with the engine system functions, evaluating their effects on aircraft safety and operational capability.

## Scope
This FHA covers engine system functions specific to 72-00 including thrust generation, control, lubrication, fuel management, and health monitoring.

## Methodology
The FHA follows ARP4761 guidelines:
1. Function identification
2. Failure condition determination
3. Safety classification assignment
4. Preliminary risk assessment

## Hazard Classification Criteria

| Classification | Description | Probability |
|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Catastrophic | Prevents continued safe flight and landing | < 10⁻⁹ per flight hour |
| Hazardous | Large reduction in safety margins | < 10⁻⁷ per flight hour |
| Major | Significant reduction in safety margins | < 10⁻⁵ per flight hour |
| Minor | Slight reduction in safety margins | < 10⁻³ per flight hour |
| No Safety Effect | No impact on safety | No requirement |

## Identified Hazards

### H-72-00-001: Complete Loss of Thrust
- **Function**: Thrust Generation
- **Failure Condition**: Complete loss of engine thrust
- **Effect**: Catastrophic (if both engines) / Major (single engine)
- **Classification**: Context-dependent
- **Mitigations**: Engine independence, redundant systems, OEI capability

### H-72-00-002: Uncontained Engine Failure
- **Function**: Structural Integrity
- **Failure Condition**: Rotor burst with debris penetration
- **Effect**: Catastrophic - potential aircraft structural damage
- **Classification**: Catastrophic
- **Probability Requirement**: < 10⁻⁹ per flight hour
- **Mitigations**: Containment design, rotor integrity monitoring

### H-72-00-003: Engine Fire (Undetected)
- **Function**: Fire Detection and Protection
- **Failure Condition**: Engine fire without detection
- **Effect**: Hazardous - potential for fire spread
- **Classification**: Hazardous
- **Probability Requirement**: < 10⁻⁷ per flight hour
- **Mitigations**: Redundant fire detection, automatic suppression

### H-72-00-004: Loss of Engine Control
- **Function**: Engine Control
- **Failure Condition**: FADEC failure leading to loss of control
- **Effect**: Hazardous - loss of engine control authority
- **Classification**: Hazardous
- **Probability Requirement**: < 10⁻⁷ per flight hour
- **Mitigations**: Dual-channel FADEC, reversionary modes

### H-72-00-005: Fuel System Malfunction
- **Function**: Fuel Supply
- **Failure Condition**: Loss of fuel flow
- **Effect**: Major - engine flameout
- **Classification**: Major
- **Probability Requirement**: < 10⁻⁵ per flight hour
- **Mitigations**: Fuel filtering, crossfeed capability

## Summary and Next Steps
This FHA establishes the foundation for detailed safety assessments including PSSA, FMEA, and SSA.
