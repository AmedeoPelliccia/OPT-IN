# System Safety Assessment (SSA)

## Document Information
- **ATA Chapter**: 72-00 ENGINE
- **Document Type**: System Safety Assessment
- **Compliance**: ARP4761, FAR 25.1309
- **Revision**: 1.0
- **Date**: 2025-10-31

## Purpose
The System Safety Assessment (SSA) validates that the as-built system meets all safety requirements established in the FHA and refined in the PSSA, providing evidence of compliance through analysis and testing.

## Scope
This SSA covers the complete 72-00 subsystem as implemented, including all design changes, verification results, and compliance evidence.

## Assessment Summary

### Safety Objectives Met
✓ All catastrophic failure conditions have probability < 10⁻⁹ per flight hour
✓ All hazardous failure conditions have probability < 10⁻⁷ per flight hour
✓ All major failure conditions have probability < 10⁻⁵ per flight hour
✓ Design assurance levels properly applied
✓ Common cause analysis completed and mitigations implemented

## Verification Evidence

### Analysis Methods
- **Fault Tree Analysis**: Completed for all catastrophic and hazardous conditions
- **FMEA/FMES**: Completed for all components at appropriate level
- **Common Cause Analysis**: Completed with mitigation verification
- **Zonal Safety Analysis**: Completed for installation effects

### Testing Evidence
- Component-level testing results
- System integration testing results
- Environmental qualification testing (DO-160)
- Failure mode testing
- Engine certification testing

## Failure Condition Verification

For each identified hazard from the FHA:
1. Probability calculated from detailed FTA/FMEA
2. Compared against requirement
3. Verification evidence documented
4. Any deviations resolved or accepted with justification

## Compliance Statement

This 72-00 subsystem has been assessed and found compliant with:
- FAR 25.1309 requirements
- FAR 33 airworthiness standards
- ARP4761 safety assessment process
- All derived safety requirements from PSSA

## Open Items
All safety-related open items have been closed. Any remaining items are tracked in the certification plan.

## Certification Readiness
This system is ready for certification authority review and acceptance.
