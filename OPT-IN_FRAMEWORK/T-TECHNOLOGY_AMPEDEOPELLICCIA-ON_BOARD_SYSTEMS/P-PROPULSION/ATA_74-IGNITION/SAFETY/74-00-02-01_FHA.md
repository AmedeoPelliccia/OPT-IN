# ATA-74 IGNITION System Safety Assessment

## Executive Summary

The ATA-74 IGNITION system is classified as **DAL Level A (Catastrophic)** due to its critical role in engine starting and in-flight relight capability. Loss of ignition capability could prevent engine restart, leading to catastrophic consequences in certain flight conditions.

## Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA)

### Failure Condition: Loss of All Ignition Capability

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Failure Condition | Complete loss of ignition capability (all engines) |

| Probability Requirement | Extremely Improbable (<10⁻⁹ per flight hour) |

### Hazard Scenarios

#### H-74-001: Loss of Engine Start Capability (Ground)
- **Description**: Inability to start any engine on ground
- **Effect**: Flight cancellation, schedule disruption
- **Classification**: Major
- **Mitigation**: Ground power start capability, maintenance procedures

#### H-74-002: Loss of In-Flight Relight Capability (Single Engine)
- **Description**: Cannot relight one engine after shutdown/flameout
- **Effect**: Continued flight on remaining engines
- **Classification**: Hazardous
- **Mitigation**: Dual redundant ignition channels per engine

#### H-74-003: Loss of In-Flight Relight Capability (All Engines)
- **Description**: Cannot relight any engine after dual-engine flameout
- **Effect**: Loss of aircraft
- **Classification**: Catastrophic
- **Mitigation**: Dual redundant system architecture, independent power sources

#### H-74-004: Uncommanded Ignition Activation
- **Description**: Ignition activates when not commanded
- **Effect**: Potential fire hazard, fuel waste
- **Classification**: Major
- **Mitigation**: Dual-channel voting logic, BIT, fault detection

#### H-74-005: High-Voltage Arc/Flash
- **Description**: Uncontrolled HV discharge outside igniters
- **Effect**: Fire hazard, personnel injury, equipment damage
- **Classification**: Hazardous
- **Mitigation**: HV insulation monitoring, arc suppression, proper grounding

#### H-74-006: Ignition System EMI
- **Description**: EMI from ignition affects other avionics
- **Effect**: Loss or degradation of critical avionics functions
- **Classification**: Catastrophic (if affects flight-critical systems)
- **Mitigation**: EMI filtering, shielding, DO-160 compliance testing
