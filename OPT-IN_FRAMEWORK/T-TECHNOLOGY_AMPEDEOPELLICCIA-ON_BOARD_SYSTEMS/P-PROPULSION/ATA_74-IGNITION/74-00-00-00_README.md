## System Description

The ignition system provides reliable, redundant ignition capability for engine starting and in-flight relight. The system consists of high-voltage exciters, spark plugs, control electronics, power supplies, and comprehensive monitoring and protection features.

### Key Features

- Dual-channel redundancy for fail-operational capability
- High-energy spark generation (multi-joule capability)
- Precise timing control synchronized with engine rotation
- Comprehensive health monitoring and diagnostics
- DO-178C Level A certified control software
- Lightning and EMI protection
- Ground test and maintenance interfaces

## Safety Classification

- **Safety Criticality**: DAL Level A (catastrophic failure condition)
- **Redundancy**: Dual-channel with independent power supplies
- **Certification Basis**: FAR 33.37, CS-E 40, DO-160, DO-178C
