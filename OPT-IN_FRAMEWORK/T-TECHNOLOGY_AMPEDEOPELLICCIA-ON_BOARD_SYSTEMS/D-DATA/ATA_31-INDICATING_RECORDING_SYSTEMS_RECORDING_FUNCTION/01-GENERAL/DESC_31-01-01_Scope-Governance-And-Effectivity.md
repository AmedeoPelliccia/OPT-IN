## 5.0 Safety Classification

### 5.1 Criticality

**Classification:** Critical - Flight Safety Item / Accident Investigation Evidence

**Rationale:**
- Essential for accident/incident investigation
- Regulatory requirement for aircraft certification
- Evidence integrity impacts aviation safety oversight
- Data loss may impair accident cause determination

### 5.2 Hazards

Identified hazards include:
1. Loss of flight data recording capability
2. Loss of CVR audio recording capability
3. Corruption of recorded data
4. Unauthorized access to sensitive recordings
5. Failure to meet mandatory parameter requirements
6. Data loss due to power interruption or crash impact
7. Tool malfunction during download
8. Chain-of-custody breach

Mitigation strategies are documented in `DESC_31-02-01_FDR-System-Description.md` and `DESC_31-03-01_CVR-System-Description.md`.
