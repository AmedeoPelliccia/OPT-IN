# EWIS Procedure - Connector Assembly and Pinning

**Document Type:** PROC  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-09-01

## 1. Purpose
This procedure establishes requirements for assembling and pinning electrical connectors.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all electrical connectors including MIL-DTL-38999, D-subminiature, and other circular and rectangular connectors.

## 3. Tools and Equipment
- Crimping tool (calibrated, within calibration date)
- Insertion/extraction tools specific to connector type
- Wire strippers (calibrated for wire gauge)
- Magnifying glass or microscope (minimum 10x magnification)
- Go/No-Go gauge for crimp inspection

## 4. Wire Preparation
- Strip wire to length specified by contact manufacturer (typically 0.15-0.20 inch).
- Ensure no nicks or cuts in conductor strands.
- Do not tin wire ends before crimping (unless specifically required).
- Remove exactly the amount of insulation required; no exposed conductor should be visible outside contact.

## 5. Contact Crimping
- Select correct contact size for wire gauge.
- Insert wire into contact barrel until insulation butts against barrel end.
- Position contact in crimping tool die.
- Crimp with steady, full stroke of tool.
- Inspect crimp with Go/No-Go gauge: Contact must pass "Go" and fail "No-Go."
- Inspect crimp visually for:
  - Correct die impression
  - No insulation in crimp barrel
  - No exposed conductor outside contact
  - No damaged insulation

## 6. Contact Insertion
- Verify connector insert cavity size matches contact size.
- Insert contact with proper insertion tool.
- Push contact until positive lock is felt/heard.
- Perform pull test: Contact must withstand 2-5 pounds pull force without extracting.

## 7. Connector Assembly
- Inspect connector insert for damage or foreign objects.
- Install connector backshell and cable clamp.
- Route wires with proper bend radius and no tension on contacts.
- Tighten cable clamp to manufacturer specifications.
- Install connector coupling ring and torque per specification.

## 8. Contact Removal
- Use correct extraction tool for contact type.
- Apply steady pull force while pushing extraction tool.
- Do not twist or bend contact during extraction.
- Inspect cavity for damage after extraction.

## 9. Inspection and Testing
- Perform visual inspection with magnification.
- Verify proper contact engagement.
- Perform continuity test on all circuits.
- For high-reliability applications: Perform hi-pot test at specified voltage.

## 10. Workmanship Record
A workmanship record is required for all critical connectors (power distribution, flight control, engine control).
Record must include:
- Connector part number and serial number
- Wire identification numbers
- Contact part numbers
- Crimping tool ID and calibration due date
- Operator and inspector signatures
- Date of assembly
