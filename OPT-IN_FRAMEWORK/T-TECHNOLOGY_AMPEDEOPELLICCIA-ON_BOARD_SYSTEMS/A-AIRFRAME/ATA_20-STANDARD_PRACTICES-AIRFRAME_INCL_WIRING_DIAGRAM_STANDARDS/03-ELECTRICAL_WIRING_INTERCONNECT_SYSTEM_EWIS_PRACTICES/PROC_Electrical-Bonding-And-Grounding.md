# EWIS Procedure - Electrical Bonding and Grounding

**Document Type:** PROC  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-09-01

## 1. Purpose
This procedure establishes requirements for electrical bonding and grounding of aircraft structures and equipment.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all bonding and grounding connections for lightning protection, EMI/EMC, and fault current return paths.

## 3. Definitions
- **Bonding:** Electrical connection between metallic parts to ensure electrical continuity.
- **Grounding:** Connection to aircraft structure (ground reference).
- **Primary Structure Bond:** Bond to primary load-bearing structure; maximum 2.5 milliohms.
- **Secondary Bond:** Bond to non-structural components; maximum 5.0 milliohms.

## 4. Surface Preparation
- Remove paint, anodizing, or other non-conductive coatings from bonding surfaces.
- Clean with approved solvent to remove oils and contamination.
- Abrade surface with Scotch-Brite or 180-grit sandpaper to bright metal.
- Clean again with solvent after abrading.
- Complete bond installation within 4 hours of surface preparation.

## 5. Bonding Strap Installation
- Use bonding strap with appropriate ampacity for fault current.
- Route strap with minimum length and maximum direct path.
- Avoid sharp bends (minimum bend radius: 10 times strap width).
- Install bonding washers or star washers under fastener heads.
- Torque fasteners per standard torque table.

## 6. Bonding Verification
- Measure bond resistance with calibrated bond meter.
- Perform 4-wire measurement for accuracy.
- Test current: Minimum 10 amperes DC.
- Maximum allowable resistance:
  - Primary structure: 2.5 milliohms
  - Secondary structure: 5.0 milliohms
  - Equipment grounding: 10.0 milliohms

## 7. Composite Structure Bonding
- CFRP structures are conductive but require mesh or foil for reliable bonding.
- Install copper mesh or expanded copper foil on CFRP surfaces.
- Use multiple fasteners (minimum 3) for bond connections.
- Verify bond resistance meets requirements after installation.

## 8. Lightning Protection
- Lightning diverter strips must have continuous electrical path.
- Bond joints in lightning path: Maximum 1.0 milliohm.
- Install bonding jumpers across hinges, bearings, and control surface attachments.

## 9. Corrosion Prevention
- Apply corrosion inhibitor to bond connections in wet or corrosive environments.
- Use stainless steel or cadmium-plated steel fasteners for bonds.
- Do not mix dissimilar metals without isolation or corrosion prevention.

## 10. Documentation
- Record bond resistance measurements on workmanship record.
- Include: Location, bond meter ID, measured resistance, date, operator.
- Photograph installed bonds for record retention.
- Bonds in critical systems (fuel, lightning) require inspector verification.

## 11. Maintenance and Inspection
- Inspect bonds for corrosion, looseness, or damage during scheduled inspections.
- Re-measure bond resistance if visual inspection reveals concerns.
- Replace bonding straps showing signs of corrosion or damage.
