# EWIS Procedure - Wire Termination (Crimping and Splicing)

**Document Type:** PROC  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-09-01

## 1. Purpose
This procedure establishes requirements for wire termination using crimping and splicing methods.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all wire terminations and splices in aircraft electrical systems.

## 3. Crimping Method

### 3.1 Terminal Selection
- Select terminal rated for wire gauge and current capacity.
- Use insulated terminals for general applications.
- Use non-insulated terminals where heat shrink will be applied.
- Verify terminal material is compatible with wire material (copper-to-copper).

### 3.2 Wire Preparation
- Strip wire to length specified by terminal manufacturer.
- Typical strip length: 0.15-0.25 inch (4-6 mm).
- Ensure no nicks or cuts in conductor strands.
- Remove oxidation from aluminum conductors with wire brush.

### 3.3 Crimping Process
- Select correct crimping tool and die for wire gauge and terminal type.
- Verify crimping tool is within calibration date.
- Insert wire into terminal barrel until insulation butts against barrel.
- Position terminal in crimping die with proper alignment.
- Apply steady, full stroke of crimping tool.
- Do not release and re-crimp; discard terminal if crimp is unsatisfactory.

### 3.4 Crimp Inspection
Visual inspection:
- Correct die impression pattern visible on terminal.
- No insulation in crimp barrel.
- No exposed conductor beyond insulation support.
- No fractured or cracked terminal barrel.

Dimensional inspection with Go/No-Go gauge:
- Crimp must pass through "Go" gauge.
- Crimp must not pass through "No-Go" gauge.

Pull test (sample basis or critical applications):
- Pull force must meet or exceed minimum specified for wire gauge.
- Wire must not pull out of terminal.

### 3.5 Terminal Installation
- Install terminal on stud or binding post with proper washer arrangement.
- Torque fastener per standard torque table.
- Ensure terminal lug cannot rotate under load.

## 4. Splicing Method

### 4.1 When to Use Splices
- Temporary repairs (must be replaced during next major maintenance).
- Emergency repairs when connector or wire replacement is not immediately available.
- Approved permanent splices per AMM or engineering authorization.

### 4.2 Splice Preparation
- Strip both wires to length specified by splice manufacturer.
- Stagger splice locations: Minimum 3 inches between splices in same bundle.
- Select splice barrel rated for wire gauge and current.

### 4.3 In-Line Splice (Butt Splice)
- Insert first wire into splice barrel until it reaches center stop.
- Crimp first barrel with calibrated crimping tool.
- Insert second wire into opposite barrel until it reaches center stop.
- Crimp second barrel.
- Inspect both crimps with Go/No-Go gauge.
- Apply heat shrink over splice: Minimum 1 inch overlap on each side.

### 4.4 Splice Sealing
- Use adhesive-lined heat shrink for environmental sealing.
- Heat shrink must completely cover splice and extend onto wire insulation.
- Verify no gaps or voids in heat shrink after installation.

## 5. Aluminum Wire Considerations
- Use aluminum-rated terminals and splices only.
- Apply joint compound (MIL-DTL-87177) to prevent oxidation.
- Torque aluminum terminals immediately after crimping (within 5 minutes).
- Do not splice aluminum wire to copper wire.

## 6. High-Temperature Applications
- Use high-temperature terminals and wire rated for application.
- Typical high-temp rating: 200°C continuous.
- Do not use standard PVC insulated terminals above 105°C.

## 7. Documentation
Wire terminations and splices in critical circuits require workmanship record:
- Wire identification number
- Terminal or splice part number
- Crimping tool ID and calibration due date
- Crimp dimension measurements (if applicable)
- Operator and inspector signatures
- Date of work

## 8. Prohibited Practices
- Do not solder wire terminations (unless specifically approved).
- Do not use twist-on wire connectors.
- Do not wrap bare wire around terminal studs.
- Do not over-crimp terminals (causes strand breakage).
- Do not splice shield or drain wires (must be continuous).
