# Corrosion Prevention and Treatment Procedure

**Document Type:** PROC  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Purpose
This procedure establishes requirements for corrosion prevention and treatment on AMPEL360 aircraft structures.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all metallic and composite structures, with emphasis on galvanic corrosion prevention in mixed-material joints.

## 3. Corrosion Prevention Methods

### 3.1 Surface Preparation
- Remove all contamination, oils, and oxidation before applying protective coatings.
- Use approved solvents and abrasive methods per material specifications.

### 3.2 Protective Coatings
- Apply primer per manufacturer specifications (MIL-PRF-23377 or equivalent).
- Ensure proper film thickness: 0.0008-0.0012 inch (20-30 Î¼m) for primers.
- Apply topcoat within specified time window after priming.

### 3.3 Galvanic Corrosion Prevention
- **CFRP/Aluminum Interfaces:** Install non-conductive isolation layer (glass fabric with resin).
- **Titanium/Aluminum Interfaces:** Use anodized aluminum or apply corrosion inhibitor.
- **Steel Fasteners in Aluminum:** Use cadmium-plated or stainless steel fasteners only.

## 4. Corrosion Inspection
- Inspect critical zones every A-check interval.
- Document corrosion findings with photos and dimensional measurements.
- Use corrosion severity rating: Level 1 (surface), Level 2 (pitting), Level 3 (structural).

## 5. Corrosion Treatment

### 5.1 Light Surface Corrosion (Level 1)
- Remove corrosion with Scotch-Brite or fine abrasive.
- Clean with approved solvent.
- Apply corrosion inhibitor and touch-up coating.

### 5.2 Pitting Corrosion (Level 2)
- Remove corrosion mechanically to clean metal.
- Measure pit depth and compare to allowable limits in SRM.
- Blend edges with 10:1 taper ratio.
- Apply primer and topcoat per manufacturer specifications.

### 5.3 Structural Corrosion (Level 3)
- Requires engineering disposition and SRM reference.
- May require structural repair or part replacement.

## 6. Critical Zones
- Wet bays and bilge areas: Inspect every 600 flight hours.
- Battery compartments: Inspect for electrolyte spillage every 200 flight hours.
- Wheel wells: Inspect for road salt and de-icing fluid corrosion every 300 flight hours.
