# Fastener Installation and Removal Procedure

**Document Type:** PROC  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Purpose
This procedure establishes requirements for installation and removal of structural fasteners.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all threaded and blind fasteners used in aircraft structures.

## 3. Hole Preparation

### 3.1 Drilling
- Use sharp drill bits appropriate for material (HSS for aluminum, carbide for CFRP).
- Maintain drill speed and feed rate per material specifications.
- For CFRP: Use backing material to prevent delamination on exit side.
- Ensure holes are perpendicular to surface within Â±2 degrees.

### 3.2 Hole Inspection
- Inspect for damage, burrs, elongation, and out-of-round conditions.
- Maximum hole elongation: 0.005 inch (0.13 mm).
- Maximum out-of-round: 0.003 inch (0.08 mm).
- Deburr all holes with appropriate deburring tool.

### 3.3 Hole Cleaning
- Remove all drilling debris and contamination.
- For CFRP holes: Vacuum dust immediately to prevent contamination.
- Wipe with approved solvent if oil or grease is present.

## 4. Fastener Installation

### 4.1 Fastener Selection
- Verify correct part number, grip length, and material.
- Grip length must accommodate all layers plus 1-2 threads protruding past nut.
- Do not mix fastener types within a joint.

### 4.2 Interference-Fit Fasteners
- Interference range: 0.0005-0.002 inch (0.013-0.051 mm).
- Install with steady, even force using hydraulic or pneumatic installation tool.
- Do not hammer or impact-drive interference fasteners.

### 4.3 Clearance-Fit Fasteners
- Apply anti-seize compound or thread lubricant as specified.
- Install fastener through all holes without force.
- Ensure washer (if required) is positioned correctly under nut or bolt head.

## 5. Torque Application
- Follow torque values in DATA_Standard-Torque-Values.csv.
- Use calibrated torque wrench within its effective range (20-80% of full scale).
- Apply torque smoothly without jerking motions.
- For torque-plus-angle fasteners: Torque to specified value, then rotate additional angle.

## 6. Fastener Removal
- Use proper size wrenches and sockets to avoid damage.
- For seized fasteners: Apply penetrating oil and allow to soak.
- If drilling out is required: Use drill bit 0.010-0.020 inch smaller than fastener diameter.

## 7. Inspection After Installation
- Verify proper protrusion of threads beyond nut (1-3 threads visible).
- Check for proper seating of fastener heads and washers.
- Ensure no cracks or damage to surrounding structure.
