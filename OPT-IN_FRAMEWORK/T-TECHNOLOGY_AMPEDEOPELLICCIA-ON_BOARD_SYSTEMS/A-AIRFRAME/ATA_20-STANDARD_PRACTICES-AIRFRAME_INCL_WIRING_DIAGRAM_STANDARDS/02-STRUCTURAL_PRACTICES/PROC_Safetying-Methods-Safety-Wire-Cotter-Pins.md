**Document Type:** PROC  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Purpose
This procedure establishes requirements for safety wiring and cotter pin installation.

## 2. Safety Wire Installation

### 2.1 Wire Selection
- Use MS20995 or AS21996 stainless steel safety wire.
- Wire diameter selection:
  - Fasteners up to 1/4 inch: 0.020-0.032 inch diameter wire
  - Fasteners 5/16 to 1/2 inch: 0.032-0.041 inch diameter wire
  - Fasteners larger than 1/2 inch: 0.041-0.051 inch diameter wire

### 2.2 Installation Method
- Safety wire must be installed to pull fasteners in the tightening direction.
- Twist wire tight with 6-8 twists per inch.
- Do not over-twist wire to the point of breaking.
- Cut wire ends 1/4 to 1/2 inch past last twist and bend ends back into structure.

### 2.3 Double-Twist Method
- Pass wire through hole in first fastener and loop around second fastener.
- Twist both strands together evenly.
- Ensure wire maintains tension throughout installation.

### 2.4 Single-Wire Method
- Use for single fasteners or last fastener in a series.
- Loop wire through hole and around adjacent structure.
- Twist wire back on itself.

## 3. Cotter Pin Installation

### 3.1 Cotter Pin Selection
- Use MS24665 cotter pins.
- Cotter pin diameter must fill at least 75% of the hole diameter.
- Length must allow for proper spreading without excessive protrusion.

### 3.2 Installation Method
- Insert cotter pin through hole with head seated against castle nut or clevis.
- Bend one leg 45-60 degrees over nut or clevis.
- Cut other leg if necessary to maintain 1/4 inch maximum protrusion.
- Bend cut leg flat against bolt or structure.

### 3.3 Prohibited Practices
- Do not reuse cotter pins.
- Do not back off castle nut to align cotter pin hole.
- Do not use cotter pins as a substitute for safety wire.

## 4. Inspection
- Verify safety wire is tight and has no sharp ends.
- Check that cotter pins are properly spread and seated.
- Replace any damaged or corroded safety devices immediately.
