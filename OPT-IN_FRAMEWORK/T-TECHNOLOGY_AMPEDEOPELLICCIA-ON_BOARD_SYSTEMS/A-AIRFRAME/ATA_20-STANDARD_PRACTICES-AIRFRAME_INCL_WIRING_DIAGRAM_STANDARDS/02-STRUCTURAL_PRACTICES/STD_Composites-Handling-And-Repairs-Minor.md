# Composites Handling and Minor Repairs Standard

**Document Type:** STD  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Scope
This standard defines requirements for handling composite materials and performing minor repairs on carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) structures.

## 2. Safety Requirements

### 2.1 Personal Protection
- Wear respiratory protection (minimum N95) when sanding or machining CFRP.
- Use chemical-resistant gloves when handling uncured resins and solvents.
- Wear long sleeves and protective clothing to prevent skin contact with fibers.

### 2.2 Dust Control
- Use vacuum systems with HEPA filters during all machining operations.
- Wet-sand whenever possible to minimize airborne dust.
- Clean work area thoroughly after composite work.
- Dispose of composite waste according to environmental regulations.

## 3. Material Handling

### 3.1 Storage
- Store prepreg materials at specified temperature (typically -18째C / 0째F).
- Allow frozen materials to reach room temperature before opening sealed bags.
- Track out-time for prepreg materials (time at room temperature).
- Do not use materials beyond their expiration date or out-time limit.

### 3.2 Cutting and Machining
- Use sharp carbide tools specifically designed for composites.
- Support material on both sides of cut to prevent delamination.
- Use slow cutting speeds and high feed rates.
- Provide adequate vacuum or coolant to control dust and heat.

## 4. Minor Repairs (Non-Structural)

### 4.1 Damage Assessment
- Minor repairs are limited to cosmetic damage and non-structural laminates.
- Damage depth must not exceed outer 2 plies or 0.040 inch (1.0 mm).
- Any damage exceeding these limits requires engineering disposition.

### 4.2 Repair Preparation
- Mark damaged area with a 1-inch border around visible damage.
- Sand damaged area with 120-grit sandpaper to sound material.
- Taper edges at 20:1 ratio (20 units distance per 1 unit depth).
- Clean with approved solvent (MEK or acetone).

### 4.3 Repair Layup
- Use repair materials compatible with original laminate (same resin system).
- Apply plies in same orientation as original laminate.
- Extend each ply 0.5 inch beyond the ply below (stepping).
- Remove entrapped air with roller or squeegee.

### 4.4 Curing
- Vacuum bag repair area if possible (minimum 22 inches Hg vacuum).
- Cure per resin manufacturer specifications.
- Typical cure: Room temperature 24 hours + post-cure at 180째F (82째C) for 4 hours.
- Monitor cure temperature with thermocouples.

## 5. Galvanic Corrosion Prevention
- Always isolate CFRP from aluminum with glass fabric isolation layer.
- Use titanium or stainless steel fasteners in CFRP structures.
- Apply corrosion inhibitor at all CFRP/metal interfaces.
- Do not allow CFRP dust to contact aluminum structures (causes galvanic corrosion).

## 6. Quality Assurance
- Inspect repairs with tap test or ultrasonic inspection.
- Document all repairs with photos and workmanship record.
- Apply repair identification decal near repaired area.
