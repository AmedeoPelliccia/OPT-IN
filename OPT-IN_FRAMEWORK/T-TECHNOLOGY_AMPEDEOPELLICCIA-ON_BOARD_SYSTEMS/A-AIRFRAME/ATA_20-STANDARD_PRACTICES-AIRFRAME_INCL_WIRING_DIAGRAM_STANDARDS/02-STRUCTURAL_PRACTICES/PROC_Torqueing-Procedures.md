# Torqueing Procedures

**Document Type:** PROC  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Purpose
This procedure establishes requirements for proper torqueing of threaded fasteners.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all threaded fasteners requiring specific torque values.

## 3. Torque Wrench Selection
- Select torque wrench with capacity appropriate for the task.
- Use wrench within 20-80% of its full-scale range for best accuracy.
- Verify calibration is current before use.

## 4. Torque Application Methods

### 4.1 Standard Torque Method
- Apply torque smoothly in a continuous motion.
- Do not jerk or impact the wrench.
- Stop applying force immediately when wrench indicates target torque is reached.

### 4.2 Torque-Plus-Angle Method
- Torque fastener to specified initial torque value.
- Mark bolt head and adjacent structure.
- Rotate fastener the specified angle beyond initial torque.
- Final torque value may exceed initial value but must not exceed maximum specified.

### 4.3 Torque Sequence
- For multi-fastener patterns, follow specified torque sequence.
- Typical pattern: Start at center and work outward in a spiral or cross pattern.
- Perform initial pass at 50% of final torque, then full torque on second pass.

## 5. Torque Values
- Reference DATA_Standard-Torque-Values.csv for standard fastener torques.
- Component-specific torques are found in the applicable AMM task cards.
- Lubricated vs. dry torque values:
  - Dry threads: Higher torque required
  - Lubricated threads: Reduced torque (typically 75-80% of dry value)

## 6. Torque Verification
- For critical joints, use torque stripe or torque seal after final torque.
- Re-torque after first flight if specified in AMM.
- Document torque values on workmanship record for critical applications.

## 7. Special Considerations

### 7.1 Composite Structures
- Use lower torque values to prevent crushing of composite laminates.
- Follow specific torque-plus-angle method for CFRP joints.
- Do not exceed maximum clamping load specified for composite material.

### 7.2 High-Temperature Applications
- Account for thermal expansion and contraction.
- May require re-torque after thermal cycling.

### 7.3 Self-Locking Fasteners
- Do not exceed maximum torque to avoid damaging locking feature.
- Replace self-locking nuts after specified number of installations (typically 5 times).

## 8. Troubleshooting
- If torque cannot be achieved: Check for thread damage, incorrect fastener, or insufficient grip length.
- If fastener continues to rotate past target torque: Stop and inspect for stripped threads.
