# ATA 20: Standard Practices - Airframe & EWIS

**CRITICAL WORKMANSHIP MANDATE:** This chapter contains the **only approved standards** for all physical maintenance work. Any task performed outside these practices requires a formal Engineering Order.

## Scope
This chapter is the authoritative source for **how** to perform common maintenance tasks. It covers structural practices (fastening, composites, corrosion) and the complete set of standards for the Electrical Wiring Interconnect System (EWIS).

## Critical Zones & Safety
- **Zones:** All work must account for special zones: Flammable (fuel/Hâ‚‚), Wet/Condensing, High-Temperature, and High-Voltage (HV).
- **PPE & ESD:** ESD-controlled environment (wrist straps, grounded mats) is mandatory for all avionics and EWIS work. Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) is mandatory before any work on HV systems.
- **Composite Cautions:** Strict adherence to dust control, hole preparation, and galvanic corrosion prevention is required.

## Governance
- **Zero Deviation:** All AMM tasks inherit these methods.
- **Calibration Control:** All calibrated tooling (crimpers, torque wrenches, bond meters) must be within its calibration date. A Go/No-Go check is required before each use.
- **Materials Authority:** Only parts from the approved parts lists are permitted.
- **Workmanship Records:** Each critical structural or EWIS joint requires a completed workmanship record.
