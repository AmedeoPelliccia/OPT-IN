# Fluid Line and Hose Installation Procedure

**Document Type:** PROC  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Purpose
This procedure establishes requirements for installation of fluid lines and flexible hoses.

## 2. Scope
Applies to hydraulic, fuel, pneumatic, and other fluid-carrying lines and hoses.

## 3. General Requirements
- Use only approved hose and fittings per IPC or AMM.
- Verify hose and fitting compatibility with fluid type and pressure rating.
- Inspect hose for manufacture date: Do not install hose more than 10 years old.

## 4. Hose Assembly

### 4.1 Hose Cutting
- Cut hose perpendicular to axis using proper hose cutter.
- Do not use hack saw or other tools that may damage reinforcement.
- Deburr hose end and remove loose particles.

### 4.2 Fitting Installation
- Measure and mark hose length including fitting engagement.
- Lubricate hose inner diameter and fitting pilot with compatible lubricant.
- Push fitting into hose with twisting motion until fully seated.
- Verify fitting socket fully engages hose reinforcement.
- For crimped fittings: Use manufacturer-approved crimping tool and die.
- For reusable fittings: Torque collar nut per manufacturer specification.

### 4.3 Proof Testing
- Pressure test each hose assembly to 1.5× maximum operating pressure.
- Hold test pressure for 5 minutes minimum.
- Inspect for leaks at fittings and along hose length.
- Mark hose assembly with test date and pressure.

## 5. Hose Installation

### 5.1 Routing
- Route hose with natural bend radius (no kinks or sharp bends).
- Minimum bend radius: 6× hose outside diameter (or per manufacturer specification).
- Avoid routing near sharp edges, hot surfaces, or moving parts.
- Route hose to allow for thermal expansion and contraction.

### 5.2 Twist Prevention
- Do not twist hose during installation.
- Align hose lay line (stripe) throughout length of hose.
- Lay line must not spiral more than 1/4 turn along hose length.

### 5.3 Length Requirements
- Hose must be long enough to allow for:
  - System pressurization (hose expands 2-4%)
  - Thermal expansion of metal fittings
  - Movement of articulating components
- Hose must not be under tension or compression when installed.

### 5.4 Support and Clamping
- Support hose at intervals specified in DATA_Clamp-Spacings-And-Bend-Radii.csv.
- Use cushion clamps to prevent chafing.
- Do not compress hose more than 10% of diameter with clamp.
- Support hose near fittings to prevent stress on connection.

## 6. Rigid Line Installation

### 6.1 Tube Bending
- Use proper tube bender to prevent flattening or kinking.
- Minimum bend radius: 3× tube outside diameter for aluminum, 2.5× for steel.
- Maximum wall thinning: 20% at outside of bend.

### 6.2 Flared Fitting Installation
- Inspect flare for cracks, scratches, or distortion.
- Flare angle: 37 degrees for AN fittings.
- Apply thin coat of thread lubricant to male threads only.
- Torque nut per standard torque table.

### 6.3 Flareless (Bite-Type) Fittings
- Pre-set fitting per manufacturer instructions before final installation.
- Verify ferrule engagement with nut removed.
- Torque to manufacturer specification (typically less than flared fittings).

## 7. System-Specific Requirements

### 7.1 Fuel Lines
- Use only fuel-resistant hose (MIL-DTL-25579 or equivalent).
- Bond hose to structure at both ends: Maximum 1 ohm resistance.
- Install fire sleeve in designated fire zones.
- Pressure test to 1.5× maximum operating pressure + fuel head pressure.

### 7.2 Hydraulic Lines
- Use MIL-DTL-8791 or equivalent hose.
- Operating pressure typically 3000-5000 psi.
- Support at closer intervals due to high pressure.
- Cap all openings immediately to prevent contamination.

### 7.3 Pneumatic Lines
- Use pressure-rated hose or tubing for system pressure.
- For bleed air: Use high-temperature hose rated to 450°F (230°C) minimum.
- Install quick-disconnect fittings with safety clips.

## 8. Leak Testing
- Pressure test system after hose installation.
- Verify no leaks at fittings or along hose length.
- For fuel systems: Perform both pressure and suction leak tests.
- Document leak test results on workmanship record.

## 9. Identification
- Install identification sleeves on hose showing:
  - System identification
  - Fluid type
  - Pressure rating
  - Manufacture/installation date
