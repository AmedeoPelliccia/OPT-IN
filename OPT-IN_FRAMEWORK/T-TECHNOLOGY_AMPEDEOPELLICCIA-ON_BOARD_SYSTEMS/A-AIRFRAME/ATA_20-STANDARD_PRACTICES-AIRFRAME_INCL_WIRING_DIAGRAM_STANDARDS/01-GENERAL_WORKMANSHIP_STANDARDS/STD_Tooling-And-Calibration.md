# Tooling and Calibration Standard

**Document Type:** STD  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-09-01

## 1. Scope
This standard defines requirements for selection, calibration, and use of tools for aircraft maintenance.

## 2. Calibrated Tooling Requirements
All precision measuring and torque tools must be calibrated according to the following requirements:

### 2.1 Torque Wrenches
- Calibration interval: 12 months or 5,000 cycles, whichever occurs first.
- Calibration range: ±3% of indicated value.
- Go/No-Go check required before each use.

### 2.2 Crimping Tools
- Calibration interval: 12 months or per manufacturer recommendation.
- Dimensional verification of crimp height and width required.
- Go/No-Go gauges must be used to verify each crimp.

### 2.3 Bond Meters
- Calibration interval: 12 months.
- Verification using certified reference standards required before each use.
- Maximum allowable resistance: 2.5 milliohms for primary structure bonds.

### 2.4 Micrometers, Calipers, and Gauges
- Calibration interval: 12 months.
- Accuracy: ±0.001 inch (±0.025 mm) or better.

## 3. Tool Identification
- All calibrated tools must display:
  - Calibration due date
  - Calibration certificate number
  - Tool identification number

## 4. Out-of-Calibration Tools
- Remove immediately from service and tag as "OUT OF CALIBRATION."
- Initiate investigation if tool was used while out of calibration.
- Rework may be required for work performed with out-of-calibration tools.

## 5. Tool Storage
- Store calibrated tools in protective cases.
- Protect from impacts, moisture, and temperature extremes.
- Do not use calibrated tools for non-precision tasks.

## 6. Calibration Records
- Maintain calibration records for all precision tools.
- Records must include: tool ID, calibration date, due date, and technician.
- Retain records for minimum of 10 years.
