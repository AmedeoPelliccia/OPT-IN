# ATA 53-12-02: Materials and Process (M&P) Traceability and Storage

## Material Traceability Requirements
All materials used in fuselage structural work must be traceable to their source and certified per specifications.

## Required Documentation

### Certificate of Conformance (CoC)
Required for all materials, must include:
- Material specification and lot number
- Manufacturer name and certification
- Date of manufacture
- Expiration date (if applicable)
- Compliance statement to specification

### Test Reports
Required for critical materials:
- CFRP prepregs: Tack, drape, resin content, gel time
- Adhesives: Lap shear strength, peel strength
- Metallic materials: Mechanical properties, chemical composition

### Batch Traceability
For each material batch:
1. Assign unique batch/lot identifier
2. Record receipt date and quantity
3. Record storage location
4. Track usage by work order/repair
5. Record disposal or expiration

## Storage Requirements

### Frozen Storage (-18°C)
Materials requiring frozen storage:
- CFRP prepregs
- Film adhesives
- Some paste adhesives

Storage procedures:
1. Store in sealed moisture-proof bags
2. Record into/out-of freezer dates
3. Allow 24-hour thaw time before use
4. Maximum out-time per specification (typically 7-10 days)
5. Re-freeze if not used within out-time

### Room Temperature Storage
Materials for room temp storage:
- Fasteners and hardware
- Sealants
- Metallic materials
- Cured composite parts

Storage procedures:
1. Store in controlled environment (15-30°C, <65% RH)
2. Protect from contamination
3. Maintain inventory records
4. FIFO (First In, First Out) usage

### Special Storage
- **Titanium:** Store separately from other metals to prevent contamination
- **Sealants:** Tightly sealed containers, limited shelf life
- **Adhesives:** Follow manufacturer storage requirements exactly

## Shelf Life Management

### Tracking
1. Label all materials with:
   - Receipt date
   - Expiration date
   - Batch/lot number
   - Specification
2. Maintain shelf life tracking log
3. Monthly review of approaching expirations
4. Quarantine expired materials

### Out-Time Tracking
For frozen materials:
1. Record removal date/time from freezer
2. Track cumulative out-time
3. Return to freezer when not in use
4. Discard if out-time exceeded

### Shelf Life Extension
Expired materials may be re-certified if:
1. Material visually appears acceptable
2. Re-test performed and passes all requirements
3. Engineering approval obtained
4. New expiration date assigned

## Process Control

### Approved Processes
All structural work must use approved processes:
- Bonding procedures qualified per ATA 51
- Fastener installation per ATA 20
- NDT procedures per qualified specifications
- Pressure testing per PROC_53-06-02

### Process Qualification
New or modified processes require:
1. Process specification document
2. Qualification test program
3. Test results showing compliance
4. Engineering review and approval
5. Training of personnel

### Process Monitoring
For critical processes:
1. Monitor key parameters (temperature, time, pressure)
2. Record actual values on process traveler
3. Verify parameters within specification
4. Stamp release by qualified personnel

## Personnel Qualification
Structural work requires qualified personnel:

### Composite Repair Technicians
- Trained per ATA 51 composite repair course
- Demonstrated proficiency
- Annual recertification

### NDT Inspectors
- Level II or III certification per SNT-TC-1A
- Method-specific certification (UT, EC, etc.)
- Maintain current certification

### Inspection Release Authority
- Authorized inspector stamp
- Trained on applicable procedures
- Annual audit of stamp releases

## Material Substitution
Substitution of specified materials requires:
1. Engineering review of proposed substitute
2. Verification of equivalent properties
3. Approval by Chief of Structures Engineering
4. Documentation of substitution in repair record

## Non-Conforming Material
If non-conforming material is discovered:
1. Quarantine material immediately
2. Identify all affected work
3. Conduct Material Review Board (MRB)
4. Disposition: Use-As-Is, Rework, or Scrap
5. Document disposition and corrective action

## Audits and Compliance
- Monthly material storage audits
- Quarterly process compliance audits
- Annual personnel qualification audits
- Maintain records for life of aircraft
