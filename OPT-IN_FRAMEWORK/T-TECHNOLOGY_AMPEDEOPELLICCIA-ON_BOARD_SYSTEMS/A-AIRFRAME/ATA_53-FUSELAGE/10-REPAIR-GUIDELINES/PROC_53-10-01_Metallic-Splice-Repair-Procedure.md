# ATA 53-10-01: Metallic Splice Repair Procedure

## Scope
This procedure covers the repair of metallic skin or structural components using bolted splice doubler plates.

## Applicability
- Aluminum skin panels
- Metallic floor beams
- Aluminum access panels
- Transition sections between composite and metallic structure

## Damage Assessment
1. Classify damage per DATA_53-01-03
2. Verify repair is within allowable limits
3. Obtain Engineering Disposition if required for Category 4 damage

## Materials and Tools

### Materials
- Doubler plate material (match parent material or approved substitute)
- Fasteners (Hi-Lok HL70 series or equivalent)
- Sealant (PR-1440 Class B for pressure boundary)
- Primer and paint
- Corrosion inhibiting compound

### Tools
- Drill motor with speed control
- Drill bits (proper size for fasteners)
- Rivet gun (if rivets used)
- Torque wrench (calibrated)
- Deburring tool
- Clecos or temporary fasteners

## Repair Procedure

### Step 1: Damage Removal (if required)
1. Mark extent of damage
2. Remove damaged material (if Category 3-4)
3. Blend edges to smooth transition
4. Verify damage completely removed

### Step 2: Doubler Fabrication
1. Determine doubler size (minimum 50mm overlap beyond damage)
2. Cut doubler from approved sheet material
3. Match thickness to design requirement:
   - Minor repair: 0.032"-0.040" (0.8-1.0mm)
   - Major repair: 0.063"-0.125" (1.6-3.2mm)
4. Deburr all edges
5. Clean doubler with solvent

### Step 3: Surface Preparation
1. Clean repair area with MEK or approved solvent
2. Remove corrosion (if present) by:
   - Light corrosion: Scotch-Brite pad
   - Moderate corrosion: Sanding to bare metal
3. Apply conversion coating (Alodine 1200)
4. Allow to dry per specification

### Step 4: Fastener Pattern Layout
1. Mark fastener locations per engineering drawing or standard pattern:
   - Perimeter: 25-30mm spacing
   - Field: 40-50mm grid pattern
2. Verify edge distances (minimum 2.5D from edges)
3. Verify spacing (minimum 3D between fasteners)

### Step 5: Drilling
1. Cleco doubler in position
2. Drill pilot holes (if required)
3. Drill to final size
4. Deburr both sides of all holes
5. Clean chips from holes

### Step 6: Fastener Installation
1. Apply wet sealant to doubler mating surface (if pressure boundary)
2. Position doubler and install temporary fasteners
3. Install permanent fasteners working from center outward
4. Torque all fasteners per ATA 20 torque chart
5. Verify proper collar breakoff (Hi-Lok)

### Step 7: Sealing
1. Apply fillet seal around doubler perimeter
2. Tool seal to smooth profile
3. Allow seal to cure per specification

### Step 8: Finishing
1. Clean excess sealant
2. Apply corrosion inhibiting compound
3. Prime repair area
4. Paint to match surrounding area

## Inspection and Documentation
1. Visual inspection of completed repair
2. Verify:
   - All fasteners properly installed
   - Proper torque applied
   - Seal properly applied
   - Edge distances correct
3. Pressure test if pressure boundary affected
4. Complete repair record per schema
5. Obtain stamp release from authorized inspector
6. Make aircraft log entry

## Quality Control Points
- Material traceability verified
- Correct fastener type and size
- Proper hole size and quality
- Torque values correct
- Sealant properly applied and cured
- Paint/coating restored
