# ATA 53-06-01: Pressure Vessel Philosophy and Limit Cases

## Pressure Vessel Design
The AMPEL360 BWB fuselage is designed as a continuous pressure vessel integrating passenger cabin and cargo compartments.

## Design Pressure
- **Normal Operating Pressure:** 8.5 psi differential (58.6 kPa)
- **Maximum Operating Pressure:** 9.1 psi differential (62.7 kPa)
- **Limit Pressure (1.33x Normal):** 11.3 psi differential
- **Ultimate Pressure (2.0x Normal):** 17.0 psi differential

## Limit Load Cases

### Case 1: Maximum Cabin Altitude Differential
- Flight altitude: 43,000 ft
- Cabin altitude: 8,000 ft
- Differential: 8.5 psi
- Combined with 1g flight loads

### Case 2: Emergency Descent
- Flight altitude: 43,000 ft descending
- Cabin altitude: 8,000 ft (controlled descent)
- Maximum rate: 3000 ft/min
- Differential: 9.1 psi maximum

### Case 3: Rapid Decompression
- Sudden loss of pressure integrity
- Maximum pressure differential rate: 5 psi/second
- Structure must remain intact
- Doors must remain secured

### Case 4: Pressure + Maneuver Loads
- Normal operating pressure: 8.5 psi
- Combined with 2.5g maneuver
- Critical design case for fuselage structure

## Pressure Boundary Definition
The pressure boundary includes:
- Primary fuselage skin
- Pressure bulkheads (forward and aft)
- Floor structure penetrations
- All doors and windows
- Systems penetrations (sealed)

## Leak Rate Limits
- **Acceptance:** <100 CFM at normal operating pressure
- **Monitor:** 100-200 CFM (investigate source)
- **Action Required:** >200 CFM (repair required)

## Pressure Test Requirements
See PROC_53-06-02 for detailed test procedures.

Test frequencies:
- **Initial Certification:** Ultimate pressure test (2.0x)
- **Production Acceptance:** Limit pressure test (1.33x)
- **Maintenance Pressure Test:** Normal pressure test (1.0x) after major repairs
