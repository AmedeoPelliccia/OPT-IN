# ATA 53-06-02: Seal Inspection and Pressure Test Procedure

## Seal Inspection

### Visual Inspection (Every 1000 FH)
Inspect all pressure seals for:
- Compression set or permanent deformation
- Cracks, cuts, or tears
- Contamination (oil, hydraulic fluid, etc.)
- Proper seating in seal groove

### Detailed Inspection (Every 3000 FH)
1. Remove selected seals for detailed examination
2. Measure seal cross-section (must be within ±10% of original)
3. Check seal material hardness (durometer test)
4. Replace seals showing degradation

## Pressure Test Procedure

### Test Equipment
- Calibrated pressure source (0-20 psi range)
- Precision pressure gauge (±0.1 psi accuracy)
- Leak detection system (soap solution or electronic)
- Safety relief valve set at 12 psi

### Test Setup
1. Close and secure all doors and hatches
2. Seal all normal ventilation openings
3. Install pressure test fittings
4. Connect pressure source and instrumentation
5. Brief all personnel on test procedure and safety

### Test Execution

#### Step 1: Initial Pressurization
1. Slowly increase pressure to 2 psi
2. Hold for 5 minutes
3. Inspect for obvious leaks
4. Repair any leaks found and restart test

#### Step 2: Normal Pressure Test (8.5 psi)
1. Increase pressure to 8.5 psi over 10 minutes
2. Hold for 30 minutes
3. Monitor pressure decay
4. Record pressure every 5 minutes
5. Calculate leak rate

#### Step 3: Limit Pressure Test (11.3 psi) - If Required
1. Increase pressure to 11.3 psi over 10 minutes
2. Hold for 15 minutes
3. Inspect structure for any deformation
4. Monitor for leaks

#### Step 4: Depressurization
1. Slowly release pressure over 10 minutes
2. Open doors and ventilation
3. Inspect all seals and structure
4. Document any findings

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Leak Rate:** <100 CFM at 8.5 psi (see DATA_53-06-03)
- **Pressure Decay:** <0.5 psi over 30 minutes
- **No Structural Deformation:** Visual inspection confirms no permanent deformation

### Documentation
- Complete pressure test log with all readings
- Photograph any leaks or defects found
- Record repair actions taken
- Obtain stamp release for test completion
