# ATA 53-13-01: Nonconformance Handling and Engineering Disposition

## Purpose
This procedure defines the process for handling nonconformances (NCRs) and obtaining Engineering Dispositions for fuselage structural work.

## Nonconformance Definition
A nonconformance is any deviation from:
- Approved design drawings
- Approved repair procedures
- Material specifications
- Quality requirements
- Regulatory requirements

## When to Initiate NCR

### Mandatory NCR Initiation
1. Damage exceeds repairable limits (Category 4)
2. Repair procedure cannot be followed as written
3. Non-approved material must be used
4. Quality escape (defect found after release)
5. Regulatory requirement not met

### Discretionary NCR
May be initiated for:
- Process variations requiring documentation
- Non-standard repair situations
- Unusual findings during inspection

## NCR Process Flow

### Step 1: Discovery and Documentation
1. Identify nonconformance
2. Tag and quarantine affected item/area (if applicable)
3. Initiate NCR using template (DATA_53-13-02)
4. Document:
   - Description of nonconformance
   - Location and extent
   - Affected MSN and work order
   - Photos and measurements
   - Discovery date and discoverer

### Step 2: Initial Review
Quality Assurance reviews NCR for:
- Completeness of documentation
- Proper classification
- Immediate safety concerns
- Affected population

### Step 3: Engineering Disposition
Engineering reviews and provides one of these dispositions:

#### Use-As-Is
- Nonconformance has no impact on safety or function
- No corrective action required
- Document rationale
- Update inspection criteria if needed

#### Rework
- Correct nonconformance to meet original specification
- Define rework procedure
- May require re-inspection or re-testing
- Most common disposition for structural NCRs

#### Repair
- Accept nonconformance and implement approved repair
- Repair must meet same safety/function requirements
- New repair procedure may be required
- Common for damage that cannot be restored to original

#### Scrap/Replace
- Nonconformance cannot be economically repaired
- Replace component with new or serviceable unit
- Rare for primary structure (very expensive)

### Step 4: Implementation
1. Perform disposition action
2. Verify completion per specification
3. Conduct required inspections/tests
4. Document actual work performed

### Step 5: Closure
1. Verify all actions complete
2. Update affected documentation
3. Close NCR in system
4. Archive NCR record
5. Analyze for systemic issues

## Engineering Disposition Requirements

### When Engineering Disposition Required
- All Category 4 damage
- Repair deviations from approved procedures
- Material substitutions
- Design changes
- Test failures

### Disposition Documentation
Engineering Disposition must include:
1. NCR reference number
2. Description of issue
3. Engineering analysis:
   - Load analysis (if applicable)
   - Margin of safety calculation
   - Regulatory compliance review
4. Recommended disposition
5. Limitations or conditions
6. Testing requirements (if any)
7. Approval signatures:
   - Responsible Engineer
   - Chief of Structures Engineering
   - Airworthiness (if regulatory impact)

### Temporary Dispositions
For urgent situations:
1. Verbal approval may be given by Chief Engineer
2. Must be confirmed in writing within 24 hours
3. Document temporary approval in NCR

## Material Review Board (MRB)
For significant nonconformances, convene MRB:

### MRB Membership
- Quality Assurance (Chair)
- Structures Engineering
- Airworthiness
- M&P Engineering
- Others as needed

### MRB Authority
- Approve dispositions for significant NCRs
- Require additional testing or analysis
- Escalate to Program Management if needed
- Direct corrective action for systemic issues

## Trend Analysis
Quality Assurance must:
1. Track all NCRs by type and cause
2. Identify recurring issues
3. Report trends monthly
4. Initiate corrective action for systemic problems

## Regulatory Reporting
Report to certification authority when:
- Safety-critical nonconformance discovered
- Affects type design or certification basis
- May require fleet action
- Required by regulatory agreement

## Records Retention
Maintain NCR records for:
- Life of affected aircraft (minimum)
- Part of permanent aircraft record
- Available for regulatory audit
- Includes all supporting documentation

## Training
All personnel performing structural work must be trained on:
- When to initiate NCR
- How to complete NCR form
- Importance of timely reporting
- Consequences of not reporting

## Corrective Action
For systemic issues identified through NCR trends:
1. Root cause analysis
2. Corrective action plan
3. Implementation and verification
4. Effectiveness check after 6 months
5. Update procedures if needed
