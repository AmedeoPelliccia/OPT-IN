# ATA 53-05-02: Floor Beam Removal and Repair Procedure

## Prerequisites
- Passenger seats and floor panels removed
- Area cleared and isolated
- Structural support installed if required

## Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Preparation
1. Document existing configuration with photos
2. Mark beam location and orientation
3. Support adjacent structure if required

### Step 2: Disconnection
1. Remove floor panel attachments
2. Disconnect Y-stringer (if applicable)
3. Remove beam-to-frame fasteners
4. Remove pressure seals

### Step 3: Beam Removal
1. Carefully extract beam from installation
2. Inspect attachment fittings for damage
3. Clean mounting surfaces

## Repair Procedure

### Minor Damage (Category 2-3)
1. Assess damage per ATA 51 damage classification
2. Repair per applicable procedure:
   - CFRP beams: bonded repair per ATA 51-10-02
   - Aluminum beams: doubler plate per PROC_53-03-02
3. NDT verification of repair

### Major Damage (Category 4)
1. Obtain Engineering Disposition
2. Replace beam with new or serviceable unit
3. Verify replacement beam meets specification

## Installation Procedure

### Step 1: Fitting Preparation
1. Inspect all attachment fittings
2. Replace damaged fasteners or fittings
3. Apply corrosion protection to metallic parts

### Step 2: Beam Installation
1. Position beam in correct location
2. Install fasteners hand-tight
3. Verify alignment and fit

### Step 3: Torqueing and Sealing
1. Torque all fasteners per ATA 20 torque values
2. Install pressure seals at penetrations
3. Apply sealant at all interfaces

### Step 4: Verification
1. Visual inspection of installation
2. Verify fastener installation
3. Pressure test if pressure boundary affected
4. Load test if required by engineering

## Quality Requirements
- Installation stamp by authorized inspector
- Complete repair record
- Pressure test results documented
