# ATA 53-05-01: Floor Beam and Y-Stringer Overview

## Floor Structure Design
The AMPEL360 BWB floor structure is integrated into the fuselage to support passenger, cargo, and equipment loads while maintaining the pressure vessel integrity.

## Primary Floor Components

### Floor Beams
- **Type:** CFRP I-beams or aluminum alloy channels
- **Spacing:** 500mm typical
- **Attachment:** Bolted to fuselage frames
- **Load Capacity:** Designed for 9g emergency landing loads

### Y-Stringers (Seat Tracks)
- **Material:** Aluminum alloy 2024-T3 or 7075-T6
- **Configuration:** Y-section track integrated into floor beams
- **Pitch:** 25.4mm (1 inch) hole spacing per industry standard
- **Load Capacity:** 3000 lbs per seat fitting

### Floor Panels
- **Material:** Aluminum honeycomb or CFRP sandwich
- **Thickness:** 20mm typical
- **Edge Support:** All four sides supported
- **Load Rating:** 1000 kg/m² distributed load

## Load Paths
1. Passenger/cargo loads → floor panels → floor beams → frames → fuselage skin
2. Seat loads → Y-stringers → floor beams → frames
3. Emergency landing loads distribute through entire floor grid

## Pressure Boundary
- Floor beams pass through pressure vessel
- Sealed penetrations at all beam-to-frame connections
- Flexible seals accommodate thermal expansion

## Inspection Points
- Beam-to-frame attachments
- Seat track fasteners
- Floor panel edge supports
- Pressure seal integrity
