## Major Test Sequences

### 1. Ultimate Pressure Test (FSTA)
**Objective:** Demonstrate fuselage withstands 2.0x normal operating pressure without failure

**Procedure:**
1. Install pressure test equipment and instrumentation
2. Apply incremental pressure loading:
   - 1.0x Normal (8.5 psi) - hold 30 min
   - 1.33x Limit (11.3 psi) - hold 15 min
   - 1.5x Limit (12.8 psi) - hold 10 min
   - 2.0x Ultimate (17.0 psi) - hold 3 min
3. Monitor strain gauges for structural response
4. Inspect for permanent deformation or failure
5. Depressurize and conduct post-test inspection

**Success Criteria:**
- No structural failure at 2.0x normal pressure
- No permanent deformation exceeding 0.1% strain
- All doors and windows remain secured

**Reference:** STR-RPT-53-001 (Test Report)

### 2. Full-Scale Fatigue Test (FFTA)
**Objective:** Demonstrate 2x Design Service Objective (120,000 flight cycles) without widespread fatigue damage

**Test Spectrum:**
- Based on AMPEL360 design mission profile
- Include pressure cycles (0-8.5 psi)
- Include flight loads (maneuver, gust, landing)
- Include temperature cycling (-55°C to +85°C)

**Procedure:**
1. Baseline inspection (100% NDT)
2. Apply load spectrum for 30,000 cycle blocks
3. Conduct detailed inspections every 30,000 cycles
4. Continue to 120,000 cycles (2x DSO)
5. Final teardown inspection

**Monitoring:**
- Continuous strain gauge monitoring
- Acoustic emission monitoring for crack initiation
- Visual inspection every 1,000 cycles
- NDT inspection every 30,000 cycles

**Success Criteria:**
- No widespread fatigue damage at 2x DSO
- Slow crack growth demonstrated (detectable before critical)
- Damage tolerance philosophy validated

**Reference:** STR-RPT-53-002 (Test Report)

### 3. Damage Tolerance Test (Component)
**Objective:** Validate damage tolerance design philosophy and inspection intervals

**Test Articles:**
- Door cutout with artificial flaw
- Window reinforcement with induced damage
- Bonded repair validation panels

**Procedure:**
1. Introduce artificial damage (sawcut, impact, etc.)
2. Apply fatigue spectrum per design mission
3. Monitor crack/damage growth
4. Demonstrate:
   - Slow growth (detectable growth period)
   - Inspection method effectiveness
   - Residual strength with damage

**Success Criteria:**
- Damage remains stable or grows slowly (>2 inspection intervals to critical)
- Inspection methods detect damage before critical size
- Residual strength >limit load with maximum allowable damage

**Reference:** STR-RPT-53-003 (Test Report)

## Test Reports and Documentation
All tests must be documented with:
1. Test plan and procedure
2. Test article configuration and material certs
3. Instrumentation and data acquisition setup
4. Raw test data (strain, pressure, temperature, etc.)
5. Post-test inspection results
6. Analysis and comparison to predictions
7. Conclusions and certification basis

## Acceptance for Certification
The fuselage structure is acceptable for certification when:
1. All ultimate load tests pass with margin >15%
2. Fatigue test completes 2x DSO without widespread damage
3. Damage tolerance philosophy validated by test
4. All test reports reviewed and accepted by certification authority
5. Any test anomalies explained and dispositioned

## Test Schedule
- Ultimate Pressure Test: Month 24 (complete)
- Fatigue Test Start: Month 20 (ongoing)
- Fatigue Test Completion: Month 48 (projected)
- Component Tests: Month 12-36 (various)
- Certification Authority Review: Month 50
- Type Certification: Month 54 (target)
