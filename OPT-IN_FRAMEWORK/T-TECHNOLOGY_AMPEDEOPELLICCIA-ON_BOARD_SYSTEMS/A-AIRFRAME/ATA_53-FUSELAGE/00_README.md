# ATA 53: Fuselage

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** This chapter contains the Structural Repair Manual (SRM) data for the primary fuselage structure. Incorrect repair or maintenance can compromise the integrity of the pressure vessel and the overall airframe, leading to catastrophic failure. All procedures are mandatory.

## Scope and Structure
This chapter provides all technical data for the inspection, maintenance, and repair of the AMPEL360 BWB fuselage. This includes the primary load-bearing structure (frames, stringers), skin panels, floor structure, and pressure bulkheads.

## Governance
- **Zero Deviation:** All repairs must follow the methodologies defined herein or in the referenced ATA 51. Damage exceeding "repairable" limits requires a formal Engineering Disposition.
- **Qualification Basis:** All repairs are substantiated by the damage tolerance philosophy and test plans defined in `/01-GENERAL` and `/11-QUALIFICATION_AND_TEST_PLANS`.
- **Traceability:** Every structural repair requires a complete, auditable Repair Record, linking materials, processes, personnel, and NDT results per the schema in `/schemas`.

## BWB Specific Considerations
- **Integrated Structure:** The BWB "fuselage" is not a distinct tube-and-wing but a blended, continuous primary structure. Loads are distributed across complex curved surfaces.
- **Composite Dominance:** The majority of the pressure vessel is a stiffened composite shell. Damage assessment must account for non-visible impact damage (NVD), and repairs rely on certified bonded scarf repair techniques.
- **Cutout Reinforcement:** Areas around doors (ATA 52) and windows (ATA 56) have complex composite reinforcements that are critical to the load path.

## Key Cross-References
- **ATA 20:** Provides fundamental workmanship standards for fastener installation and sealing.
- **ATA 51:** Defines the master methodologies for damage assessment, NDT, and standard repair practices (especially bonded composite repair).
- **ATA 52/56:** Define the doors and windows that are installed into the fuselage cutouts.
