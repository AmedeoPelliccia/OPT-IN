# ATA 53-09-01: LSP Restoration and Continuity Test

## Lightning Strike Protection Overview
The AMPEL360 BWB fuselage incorporates integrated lightning strike protection (LSP) in the CFRP skin to ensure electrical continuity and prevent structural damage.

## LSP System Components
- **Outer Surface Mesh:** Copper or aluminum mesh embedded in outer skin ply
- **Bonding Straps:** Metallic straps connecting mesh segments
- **Fastener Bonding:** Special conductive fasteners or bonding at all fastener locations
- **Diverter Strips:** Enhanced conductivity paths at critical areas

## Inspection Requirements

### Visual Inspection (Every 1000 FH)
1. Inspect for obvious lightning strike evidence:
   - Burn marks or discoloration
   - Damaged or missing mesh
   - Damaged paint or coating
2. Check bonding strap connections
3. Verify no corrosion at bonding points

### Electrical Continuity Test (Every 3000 FH)
1. Measure resistance between structural points
2. Verify continuity per acceptance criteria below
3. Test after any lightning strike event

## Continuity Test Procedure

### Equipment
- **Ohmmeter:** 4-wire resistance measurement capable
- **Test Current:** 10 amps minimum
- **Calibration:** Verify with known resistance standard

### Test Points
Measure resistance between:
1. Adjacent frames (longitudinal continuity)
2. Adjacent stringers (circumferential continuity)
3. Skin to frame connections
4. Across bonding straps
5. Across fastener joints

### Test Procedure
1. Remove paint/coating at test points if necessary
2. Connect test leads with good electrical contact
3. Apply 10A test current
4. Measure voltage drop
5. Calculate resistance (R = V/I)
6. Compare to acceptance criteria

### Acceptance Criteria (see DATA_53-09-02)
- **Frame-to-Frame:** <2.5 milliohms
- **Stringer-to-Stringer:** <2.5 milliohms
- **Skin-to-Frame:** <5.0 milliohms
- **Bonding Strap:** <1.0 milliohm
- **Fastener Joint:** <5.0 milliohms

## LSP Damage Classification

### Category 1: Minor Surface Damage
- Burn marks on paint only
- No mesh damage
- Continuity test passes
- **Action:** Clean and repaint, monitor

### Category 2: Mesh Damage
- Visible damage to LSP mesh
- Continuity test marginal or fails locally
- **Action:** Repair LSP per procedure below

### Category 3: Structural and LSP Damage
- Both structure and LSP damaged
- **Action:** Structural repair per ATA 51, LSP restoration per this procedure

## LSP Repair Procedure

### Mesh Repair
1. Clean damaged area
2. Remove damaged mesh section (if necessary)
3. Cut replacement mesh to size (50mm overlap minimum)
4. Bond replacement mesh with conductive adhesive
5. Verify electrical connection to surrounding mesh
6. Apply protective coating

### Bonding Strap Replacement
1. Remove damaged strap
2. Clean attachment points
3. Install new strap with proper hardware
4. Torque fasteners per specification
5. Apply corrosion protection
6. Verify continuity

### Verification
1. Perform continuity test at repair
2. Verify resistance meets acceptance criteria
3. Document repair and test results
4. Photograph completed repair

## Post-Lightning Strike Inspection
After any confirmed or suspected lightning strike:
1. Conduct comprehensive visual inspection of entire fuselage
2. Perform continuity tests at suspect areas
3. Perform detailed inspection (DVI) at strike points
4. Conduct NDT (ultrasonic) if structural damage suspected
5. Complete lightning strike report
6. Repair any damage found
