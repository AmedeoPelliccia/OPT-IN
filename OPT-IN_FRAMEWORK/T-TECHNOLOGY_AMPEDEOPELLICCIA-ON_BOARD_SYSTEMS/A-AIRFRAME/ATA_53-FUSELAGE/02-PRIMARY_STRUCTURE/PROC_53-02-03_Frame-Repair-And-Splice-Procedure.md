# ATA 53-02-03: Frame Repair and Splice Procedure

## Scope
This procedure covers the repair and splicing of damaged fuselage frames.

## Prerequisites
- Damage assessment completed per ATA 51
- Engineering Disposition obtained for Category 4 damage
- Materials and tooling verified per M&P requirements

## Repair Classifications

### Minor Frame Repair (Category 2-3 Damage)
- Small cracks <25mm in non-critical areas
- Bonded doubler repair per ATA 51-10-02
- No splice required

### Major Frame Repair (Category 3-4 Damage)
- Cracks >25mm or in critical areas
- Frame section replacement required
- Spliced repair with engineering approval

## Frame Splice Procedure

### Step 1: Damage Removal
1. Mark damaged area extending 50mm beyond visible damage
2. Remove damaged section with precision cutting tools
3. Verify complete damage removal with NDT

### Step 2: Splice Preparation  
1. Fabricate replacement frame section per drawing
2. Prepare bonding surfaces per ATA 51-03-01
3. Trial fit splice and verify alignment

### Step 3: Splice Installation
1. Apply adhesive per manufacturer specification
2. Position splice with alignment fixtures
3. Install temporary fasteners if required
4. Cure per adhesive specification (typically 24hrs at room temp)

### Step 4: Fastener Installation
1. Drill holes per engineering drawing
2. Install Hi-Lok or equivalent fasteners
3. Torque per ATA 20 standard torque values
4. Install sealant at all fastener locations

### Step 5: Inspection and Documentation
1. Visual inspection of completed repair
2. NDT verification (ultrasonic for bond quality)
3. Pressure test if pressure boundary affected
4. Complete repair record per schema

## Materials
- Replacement frame sections: CFRP per material specification
- Adhesive: 3M AF-163-2 or equivalent
- Fasteners: Hi-Lok HL70 series or equivalent
- Sealant: PR-1440 Class B

## Quality Requirements
- All repairs require stamp release by authorized inspector
- Repair record submitted to engineering within 48 hours
- Include photos of damage, repair process, and final configuration
