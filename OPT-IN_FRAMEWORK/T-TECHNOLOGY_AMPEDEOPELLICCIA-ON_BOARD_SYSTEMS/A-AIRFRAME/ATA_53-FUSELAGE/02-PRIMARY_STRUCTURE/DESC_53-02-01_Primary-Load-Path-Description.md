# ATA 53-02-01: Primary Load Path Description

## BWB Fuselage Load Path Overview
The AMPEL360 BWB fuselage integrates the pressure vessel with the lifting surface, creating a unique load distribution pattern.

## Primary Structural Elements

### Frames
- Transverse frames provide circumferential stiffness
- Spacing: 500mm typical, 350mm at critical cutouts
- Material: CFRP hat-section frames with radius fillers
- Critical frames at door and window cutouts are reinforced

### Stringers
- Longitudinal stiffeners running fuselage length
- Spacing: 150mm typical
- Material: CFRP blade stringers
- Load transfer through co-cured or bonded joints to skin

### Skin
- Primary pressure containment and load-carrying element
- Multi-layer CFRP laminate optimized for each zone
- Thickness varies from 4mm to 12mm depending on loads
- Outer surface includes lightning strike protection

## Load Distribution
- Wing bending loads distribute across wide BWB cross-section
- Pressure loads react through frames to stringers to skin
- Shear loads carried by skin with frame shear ties
- Concentrated loads at landing gear, doors, and systems mounts

## Critical Load Cases
- 2.5g maneuver + cabin pressure
- -1.0g maneuver + cabin pressure  
- Crash landing loads
- Bird strike impact
- Lightning strike
