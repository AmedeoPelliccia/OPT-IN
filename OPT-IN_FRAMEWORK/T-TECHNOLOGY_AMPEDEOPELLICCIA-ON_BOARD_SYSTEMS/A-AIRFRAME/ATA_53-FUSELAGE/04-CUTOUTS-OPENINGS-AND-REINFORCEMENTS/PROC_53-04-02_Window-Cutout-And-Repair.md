# ATA 53-04-02: Window Cutout and Repair Procedure

## Scope
This procedure covers inspection and repair of window cutout reinforcements.

## Cross-Reference
See ATA 56 for window installation and removal procedures. This procedure addresses only the fuselage structure surrounding the window.

## Inspection Requirements

### Routine Inspection (Every 500 FH)
1. Visual inspection of window frame and reinforcement
2. Check for:
   - Cracks radiating from corners
   - Delamination around fastener holes
   - Corrosion (if metallic reinforcement)
   - Sealant degradation

### Detailed Inspection (Every 2000 FH)
1. Remove window per ATA 56
2. Perform detailed visual inspection of reinforcement
3. NDT inspection (ultrasonic) of bonded reinforcement
4. Verify fastener torque at critical locations

## Damage Assessment
Classify damage per DATA_53-01-03_Damage-Limits-And-Classification.csv:
- **Negligible:** Cosmetic only, record in log
- **Minor:** Small cracks <15mm, repairable per this procedure
- **Major:** Cracks >15mm or at corners, requires Engineering Disposition

## Repair Procedure (Minor Damage)

### Crack Repair
1. Drill stop-drill hole at crack tip (3mm diameter)
2. Clean area with MEK
3. Apply bonded doubler per ATA 51-10-02
4. Install mechanical fasteners if required by engineering
5. Verify repair with ultrasonic inspection

### Reinforcement Plate Replacement
1. Remove damaged reinforcement plate
2. Inspect underlying structure
3. Fabricate new reinforcement per engineering drawing
4. Bond and bolt replacement reinforcement
5. Cure per adhesive specification
6. Pressure test per PROC_53-06-02

## Quality Control
- All window cutout repairs require Engineering review
- NDT verification mandatory
- Pressure test if structure penetrated
- Complete repair record per schema

## Materials
- Reinforcement material: CFRP or Ti-6Al-4V per design
- Adhesive: 3M AF-163-2
- Fasteners: Hi-Lok HL70 series
- Sealant: PR-1440 Class B
