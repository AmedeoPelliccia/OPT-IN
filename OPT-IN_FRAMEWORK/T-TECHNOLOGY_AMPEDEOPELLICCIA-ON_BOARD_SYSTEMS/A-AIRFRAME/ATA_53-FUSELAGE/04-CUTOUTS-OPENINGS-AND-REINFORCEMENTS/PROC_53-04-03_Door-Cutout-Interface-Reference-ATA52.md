# ATA 53-04-03: Door Cutout Interface (Reference ATA 52)

## Scope
This document defines the interface between the fuselage structure (ATA 53) and door systems (ATA 52).

## Structural Responsibility

### ATA 53 (Fuselage) Scope
- Door cutout reinforcement structure
- Load-bearing frames and stringers around cutout
- Door hinge and latch attachment fittings (structural portion)
- Sealing surface preparation

### ATA 52 (Doors) Scope
- Door panel structure
- Hinge and latch mechanisms
- Door actuation systems
- Door seal installation

## Interface Requirements

### Load Transfer
Door loads are transferred to fuselage through:
1. **Hinge Fittings:** Primary load path for door weight and operational loads
2. **Latch Fittings:** Backup load path and pressure load transfer
3. **Door Frame:** Distributes loads to surrounding structure

### Reinforcement Zones
- **Zone 1 (Red):** Door corners - maximum reinforcement
- **Zone 2 (Yellow):** Door frame perimeter - standard reinforcement  
- **Zone 3 (Green):** Adjacent structure - transition reinforcement

## Inspection Requirements
Refer to ATA 52 for door inspection procedures.

Fuselage structure inspections around door cutouts:
- **Every 1000 FH:** Visual inspection of reinforcement and fittings
- **Every 3000 FH:** Detailed inspection with NDT of critical areas
- **After door strikes or incidents:** Complete structural inspection

## Repair Coordination
Any repair affecting both door and fuselage structure must be coordinated between:
- Structures Engineering (ATA 53)
- Systems Engineering (ATA 52)
- Engineering Disposition required for major repairs
