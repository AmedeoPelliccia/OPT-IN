# ATA 53-08-02: Ultrasonic and C-Scan for Fuselage

## Purpose
Ultrasonic inspection is the primary NDT method for detecting internal defects in CFRP fuselage structure, including delaminations, disbonds, and porosity.

## Inspection Methods

### Pulse-Echo Ultrasonic
- **Application:** Thickness measurement, delamination detection
- **Frequency:** 5 MHz typical for CFRP
- **Method:** Single-sided access, through-transmission simulation

### Through-Transmission Ultrasonic  
- **Application:** Bond quality verification, large area inspection
- **Frequency:** 1-2.25 MHz
- **Method:** Requires access to both sides

### C-Scan Automated Inspection
- **Application:** Large area mapping, production quality control
- **Method:** Automated scanning system
- **Output:** Color-coded image showing defect locations and depths

## Equipment Requirements
- **UT Flaw Detector:** Digital with A-scan display
- **Transducers:** 5 MHz, 0.5" diameter for spot checks
- **Automated Scanner:** For C-scan (if available)
- **Couplant:** Water-based gel (glycerin for composite)
- **Calibration Standards:** CFRP reference blocks with known defects

## Calibration Procedure
1. Use reference standard with known thickness
2. Adjust velocity setting for CFRP material (typically 2700-3000 m/s)
3. Verify detection of calibration defects
4. Document calibration settings

## Inspection Procedure

### Spot Inspection (Pulse-Echo)
1. Clean inspection surface
2. Apply couplant
3. Place transducer perpendicular to surface
4. Scan area in overlapping pattern
5. Record A-scan for each suspicious indication
6. Mark defect locations on surface

### C-Scan Inspection
1. Set up automated scanning equipment
2. Configure scan parameters:
   - Grid spacing: 2-5mm
   - Scan speed: 25-100 mm/s
   - Data acquisition rate
3. Apply couplant (immersion or water jet)
4. Execute automated scan
5. Process and analyze C-scan image
6. Identify defects based on amplitude thresholds

## Defect Acceptance Criteria

### Delaminations
- **Acceptable:** <15mm diameter, single layer
- **Monitor:** 15-25mm diameter
- **Repair Required:** >25mm diameter or multiple layers

### Porosity
- **Acceptable:** <5% by area, evenly distributed
- **Monitor:** 5-10% by area
- **Repair Required:** >10% by area or concentrated

### Disbonds (Skin-Stringer Interface)
- **Acceptable:** <25mm length
- **Monitor:** 25-50mm length
- **Repair Required:** >50mm length

## Documentation
- C-scan images (saved as digital file)
- Defect location map
- A-scan waveforms of significant indications
- Calibration records
- Inspector certification
- Inspection report per schema

## Frequency
- **Production:** 100% C-scan of all primary structure
- **Maintenance:** Spot UT at critical areas per MPD
- **After Repair:** UT verification of all bonded repairs
- **After Impact:** UT scan of impact zone +100mm margin
