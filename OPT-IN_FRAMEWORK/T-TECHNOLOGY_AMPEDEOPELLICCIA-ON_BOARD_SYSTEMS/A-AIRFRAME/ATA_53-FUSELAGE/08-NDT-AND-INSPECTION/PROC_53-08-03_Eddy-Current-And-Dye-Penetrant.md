# ATA 53-08-03: Eddy Current and Dye Penetrant

## Eddy Current Inspection

### Purpose
Detection of surface and near-surface cracks in metallic fuselage components (fittings, fasteners, landing gear mounts).

### Applications in ATA 53
- Titanium door hinge fittings
- Aluminum floor beam attachments
- Steel landing gear fittings
- Metallic fasteners in critical areas

### Equipment
- **Eddy Current Tester:** Multi-frequency capability
- **Probes:** Surface probes for general inspection, bolt-hole probes for fastener holes
- **Reference Standards:** Calibration blocks with EDM notches

### Procedure
1. Clean surface (remove paint, corrosion, contamination)
2. Calibrate equipment using reference standard
3. Select appropriate frequency (100-500 kHz typical)
4. Scan surface in overlapping passes
5. Investigate all signal indications
6. Mark and measure confirmed cracks

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Acceptable:** No crack indications
- **Investigate:** Any signal deviation from baseline
- **Reject:** Confirmed crack >0.5mm depth or >5mm length

## Dye Penetrant Inspection

### Purpose  
Detection of surface-breaking cracks in both metallic and non-metallic materials.

### Applications in ATA 53
- CFRP skin surface inspection (non-fluorescent dye only)
- Metallic fittings and attachments
- Verification of crack removal during repair
- Weld and bond line inspection

### Materials
- **Cleaner:** Solvent-based (MEK or approved equivalent)
- **Penetrant:** Type I (fluorescent) or Type II (visible red dye)
- **Developer:** Non-aqueous for CFRP, any type for metallic

### Procedure

#### Step 1: Cleaning
1. Remove all paint, sealant, or contamination
2. Clean with approved solvent
3. Allow to dry completely

#### Step 2: Penetrant Application
1. Apply penetrant to inspection area
2. Dwell time: 15-30 minutes (longer for tight cracks)
3. Ensure complete coverage

#### Step 3: Removal
1. Remove excess penetrant with clean rag
2. Wipe gently (do not over-clean)
3. Final clean with solvent dampened rag

#### Step 4: Developer Application
1. Apply thin, even coat of developer
2. Allow to develop for 10-30 minutes
3. Inspect under appropriate lighting (UV for fluorescent, white for visible)

#### Step 5: Interpretation
1. Look for penetrant indications (red lines for visible dye)
2. Measure and document all indications
3. Classify per acceptance criteria

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Acceptable:** No linear indications
- **Investigate:** Any linear indication >3mm
- **Reject:** Crack-like indications, clustered porosity

## Documentation
- Record inspection method used
- Document all indications found
- Include photos under UV or white light
- Record accept/reject decision
- Inspector certification required

## Limitations
- **Eddy Current:** Only conductive materials, surface/near-surface only
- **Dye Penetrant:** Only surface-breaking defects, requires access to suspect surface
- **CFRP Limitation:** Dye penetrant less effective on rough composite surfaces
