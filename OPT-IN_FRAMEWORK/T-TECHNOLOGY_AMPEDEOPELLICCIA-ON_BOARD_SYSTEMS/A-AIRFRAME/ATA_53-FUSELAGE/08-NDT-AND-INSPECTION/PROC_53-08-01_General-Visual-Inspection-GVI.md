# ATA 53-08-01: General Visual Inspection (GVI)

## Purpose
General Visual Inspection is the primary method for detecting obvious damage, corrosion, or anomalies in fuselage structure.

## Inspection Frequency
- **Standard:** Every 1000 flight hours or 12 months, whichever comes first
- **After Events:** Following hard landing, lightning strike, bird strike, or any incident

## Required Tools and Equipment
- High-intensity flashlight (minimum 500 lumens)
- Mirror (telescoping inspection mirror)
- Borescope for inaccessible areas
- Camera for documentation
- Checklist and inspection forms

## Inspection Procedure

### Pre-Inspection
1. Review aircraft maintenance log for previous findings
2. Review recent flight reports for crew-reported issues
3. Gather required tools and documentation
4. Ensure adequate lighting

### Primary Structure Inspection

#### Frames
- Visually inspect all accessible frames
- Look for:
  - Cracks (especially at fastener holes and radii)
  - Delamination (CFRP frames)
  - Corrosion (metallic fittings)
  - Missing or loose fasteners
  - Paint or coating damage

#### Stringers
- Inspect stringer-to-skin attachment
- Look for:
  - Disbonding (visible gaps)
  - Fastener condition
  - Surface damage
  - Alignment issues

#### Skin
- Inspect entire accessible skin surface
- Look for:
  - Dents and dings
  - Impact damage
  - Scratches through protective coating
  - Delamination (may appear as whitish area)
  - Lightning strike evidence (burn marks)
  - Fluid leaks or stains

### Critical Areas (Extra Attention)

#### Zone 1: Door and Window Cutouts
- Inspect reinforcement plates
- Check for cracks radiating from corners
- Verify seal condition
- Check fastener condition

#### Zone 2: Landing Gear Attachment
- Inspect attachment fittings
- Look for cracking at high-stress points
- Verify bolt torque markings intact

#### Zone 3: Pressure Bulkheads
- Inspect for corrosion (especially at lower edge)
- Check seal condition
- Verify no visible deformation

## Acceptance Criteria
- No cracks visible to naked eye
- No missing or obviously damaged fasteners
- No corrosion beyond "light surface corrosion"
- No fluid leaks
- No loose structure
- No delamination >15mm diameter

## Documentation
- Complete GVI inspection form
- Record all findings with:
  - Location (station, frame, stringer)
  - Description of finding
  - Estimated size
  - Photos
- Classify findings per damage classification schema
- Make appropriate log entry

## Follow-Up Actions
- **Negligible Damage:** Record in log, monitor at next inspection
- **Minor Damage:** Schedule detailed inspection or NDT
- **Repairable Damage:** Initiate repair work order
- **Major Damage:** Report to Engineering for disposition
