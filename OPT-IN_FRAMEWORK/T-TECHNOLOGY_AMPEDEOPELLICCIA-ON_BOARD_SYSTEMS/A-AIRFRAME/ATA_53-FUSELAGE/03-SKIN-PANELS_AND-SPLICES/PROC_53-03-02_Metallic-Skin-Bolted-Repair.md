# ATA 53-03-02: Metallic Skin Bolted Repair Procedure

## Scope
This procedure covers bolted repairs for metallic skin sections (typically aluminum alloy used in legacy or hybrid configurations).

## Applicability
- Aluminum skin panels in equipment bays
- Metallic access panels and covers
- Transition areas between composite and metallic structures

## Repair Procedure

### Step 1: Damage Assessment
1. Determine extent of damage
2. Classify per damage classification schema
3. Verify repair is within allowable limits

### Step 2: Material Preparation
1. Obtain repair doubler material (2024-T3 aluminum sheet)
2. Cut doubler to size (minimum 50mm overlap beyond damage)
3. Deburr all edges

### Step 3: Skin Preparation
1. Clean damaged area with MEK or equivalent
2. Remove corrosion if present
3. Apply conversion coating (Alodine 1200 or equivalent)

### Step 4: Fastener Installation
1. Layout fastener pattern per engineering drawing
2. Drill holes using proper drill bushings
3. Deburr and clean holes
4. Install wet seal (PR-1440) on mating surfaces
5. Install rivets or Hi-Lok fasteners
6. Torque fasteners per ATA 20 torque tables

### Step 5: Sealing and Protection
1. Apply fillet seal around doubler perimeter
2. Apply corrosion inhibiting compound
3. Apply primer and paint to match surrounding area

### Step 6: Inspection
1. Visual inspection of completed repair
2. Verify all fasteners properly installed
3. Check for proper edge distance and spacing
4. Perform leak check if pressure boundary

## Fastener Requirements
- **Type:** AN470AD rivets or Hi-Lok HL70 series
- **Spacing:** 4D to 6D (D = fastener diameter)
- **Edge Distance:** Minimum 2.5D
- **Material:** Aluminum alloy matching skin material

## Quality Control
- Stamp release by authorized inspector required
- Document repair in aircraft log
- Retain repair record per ATA 53 schema
