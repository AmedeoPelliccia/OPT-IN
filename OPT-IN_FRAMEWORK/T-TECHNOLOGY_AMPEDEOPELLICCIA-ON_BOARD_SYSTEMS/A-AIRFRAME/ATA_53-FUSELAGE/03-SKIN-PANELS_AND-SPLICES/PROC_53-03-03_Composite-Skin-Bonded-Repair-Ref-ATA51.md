# ATA 53-03-03: Composite Skin Bonded Repair (Reference ATA 51)

## Scope
This procedure provides specific application of ATA 51 bonded composite repair methods for fuselage skin.

## Reference Documents
- **ATA 51-10-02:** Master Composite Bonded Repair Procedure
- **ATA 51-08-01:** Composite Damage Assessment
- **ATA 51-03-01:** Surface Preparation for Bonding

## Fuselage-Specific Considerations

### Repair Area Classification
Refer to ATA 51-10-02 for general repair methodology, with the following fuselage-specific requirements:

#### Class A Repairs (Non-Structural)
- Outer cosmetic layer only
- Maximum depth: 0.25mm
- Follow ATA 51-10-02 Section 3.2

#### Class B Repairs (Minor Structural)
- Damage depth: 0.25mm to 50% of skin thickness
- Scarf ratio: 50:1 minimum
- Follow ATA 51-10-02 Section 4.1
- **Additional Requirement:** Pressure test after cure

#### Class C Repairs (Major Structural)
- Damage depth: >50% of skin thickness or through-thickness
- Scarf ratio: 100:1 minimum  
- Requires Engineering Disposition
- Follow ATA 51-10-02 Section 4.2
- **Additional Requirements:**
  - Pressure test mandatory
  - NDT verification of repair quality
  - 48-hour cure monitoring

### Pressure Vessel Considerations
All fuselage skin repairs that penetrate to the pressure vessel must:
1. Ensure complete moisture barrier restoration
2. Include pressure test verification (see PROC_53-06-02)
3. Verify seal integrity at repair edges

### Material Selection
Refer to ATA 51-12-01 for approved composite repair materials, ensuring compatibility with:
- Base skin material (T800S/5320-1)
- Operating temperature range (-55°C to +85°C)
- Moisture exposure environment

### Cure Requirements
- **Room Temperature Cure:** Acceptable for Class A and small Class B repairs
- **Elevated Temperature Cure:** Required for Class C repairs and repairs >100 cm²
- **Cure Monitoring:** Record temperature and time per ATA 51-10-02 Section 5

## Quality Assurance
All composite skin repairs require:
1. Pre-repair damage documentation (photos, measurements)
2. NDT verification (ultrasonic or thermography)
3. Pressure test if pressure boundary affected
4. Complete repair record per repair-record.schema.json

## Return to Service
- Class A: Immediate return to service after cure
- Class B: Return to service after pressure test
- Class C: Return to service after Engineering approval and all testing complete
