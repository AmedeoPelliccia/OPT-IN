# ATA 53-03-01: Skin Materials and Construction

## Skin Panel Overview
The AMPEL360 BWB fuselage skin is a multi-layer CFRP laminate that serves as both the primary load-carrying structure and the pressure vessel.

## Material Specifications

### Base Material
- **Type:** Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP)
- **Fiber:** Toray T800S or equivalent
- **Resin:** Cytec 5320-1 epoxy or equivalent
- **Form:** Unidirectional prepreg tape and woven fabric

### Layup Schedule
Typical skin layup (varies by location):
```
Outer Surface:
- LSP mesh (lightning strike protection)
- [45/0/-45/90]s base layup
- Additional 0° plies for longitudinal strength
- Additional ±45° plies for shear
Inner Surface:
- Moisture barrier coating
```

## Thickness Zones

### Zone A: Low Load Areas
- Thickness: 4-6mm
- Layup: [45/0/-45/90]2s
- Locations: Upper aft fuselage, low-stress belly panels

### Zone B: Standard Load Areas  
- Thickness: 6-8mm
- Layup: [45/0/-45/90]3s with additional 0° plies
- Locations: General fuselage, passenger cabin areas

### Zone C: High Load Areas
- Thickness: 8-12mm
- Layup: [45/0/-45/90]4s with additional 0° and ±45° plies
- Locations: Wing-body integration, landing gear mounts, door surrounds

## Manufacturing Process
- **Prepreg layup:** Hand layup or automated tape laying
- **Cure cycle:** Autoclave cure at 180°C, 6 bar pressure
- **Post-cure:** Room temperature aging for moisture equilibrium
- **Quality control:** Ultrasonic C-scan inspection of all panels

## Protective Systems
- **External:** Paint system per specification
- **Lightning Strike Protection:** Copper or aluminum mesh embedded in outer ply
- **Moisture Protection:** Sealed edges and internal moisture barrier coating

## Joining Methods
- **Skin-to-Frame:** Bonded with secondary mechanical fastening
- **Skin-to-Stringer:** Co-cured or co-bonded during manufacturing
- **Skin Splices:** Bonded scarf joints or bolted doubler plates
