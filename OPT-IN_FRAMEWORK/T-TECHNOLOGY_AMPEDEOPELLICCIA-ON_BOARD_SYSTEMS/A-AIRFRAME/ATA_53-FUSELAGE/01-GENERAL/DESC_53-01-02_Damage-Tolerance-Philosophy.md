# ATA 53-01-02: Damage Tolerance Philosophy

## Overview
The AMPEL360 BWB fuselage is designed to a damage tolerance philosophy that ensures safe operation with undetected damage for the inspection interval.

## Damage Tolerance Principles

### Fail-Safe Design
- Multiple load paths ensure structural integrity after single element failure
- Critical areas have redundant structure
- No single point of failure in primary structure

### Slow Crack Growth
- Material selection ensures subcritical crack growth rates
- Inspection intervals based on validated crack growth models
- Safety margin of 2x between detectable and critical crack sizes

### Inspection Program
- General Visual Inspection (GVI) at routine intervals
- Detailed Visual Inspection (DVI) for critical zones
- NDT methods validated for composite and metallic structures

## Design Service Objective
- Design Service Objective (DSO): 60,000 flight cycles
- All structural components must demonstrate durability to 2x DSO without widespread fatigue damage

## Composite-Specific Considerations
- Non-visible impact damage (NVD) detection protocols
- Delamination growth monitoring
- Environmental degradation assessment (moisture, temperature cycling)

## Damage Categories

### Category 1: Negligible Damage
- No structural significance
- Record in maintenance log
- No immediate action required

### Category 2: Allowable Damage
- Within allowable limits
- Continue operation
- Monitor at next scheduled inspection

### Category 3: Repairable Damage
- Exceeds allowable limits
- Repair per approved SRM procedures
- Return to service after inspection

### Category 4: Major Damage
- Exceeds repairable limits
- Requires Engineering Disposition
- May require component replacement
