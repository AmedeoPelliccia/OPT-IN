# ATA 53-14-01: Temperature and Humidity Limits

## Operating Environment
The AMPEL360 BWB fuselage is designed to operate in a wide range of environmental conditions.

## Temperature Limits

### Operating Temperature Range
- **Minimum:** -55°C (-67°F) at altitude
- **Maximum:** +85°C (+185°F) on ground in direct sunlight
- **Typical Cruise:** -40°C to -50°C

### Critical Temperature Considerations

#### Cold Temperature Effects
- CFRP becomes more brittle (reduced fracture toughness)
- Adhesives and sealants lose flexibility
- Moisture in structure may freeze
- Metal fittings contract more than composites (differential expansion)

**Maintenance Precautions:**
- Warm structure to >5°C before repair work
- Allow adhesives to warm to room temperature before use
- Monitor cure temperature for bonded repairs

#### Hot Temperature Effects
- Material properties slightly degraded
- Adhesive cure accelerated (reduced working time)
- Thermal expansion differential between materials
- Paint and coatings may soften

**Maintenance Precautions:**
- Avoid direct sun exposure during repairs
- Use temperature-controlled workspace when possible
- Adjust adhesive working time for high temperature

### Storage Temperature
- **Aircraft Storage:** -55°C to +70°C
- **Long-term Storage (>30 days):** Hangar storage preferred
- **Material Storage:** See Section 12 (M&P Traceability)

## Humidity and Moisture

### Operating Humidity
- **Ground Operations:** 0-100% relative humidity
- **Flight:** Variable, condensation possible at altitude

### Moisture Effects on CFRP

#### Moisture Absorption
- CFRP absorbs moisture over time
- Equilibrium moisture content: ~1.0% by weight
- Moisture reduces glass transition temperature (Tg)
- Minimal effect on structural properties (<5% reduction)

#### Moisture Limits for Repairs
Before bonded repair:
- **Maximum Moisture Content:** 0.5% by weight
- **Measurement:** Oven dry method or moisture meter
- **Drying:** 60°C for 24 hours if >0.5%

### Condensation and Ice
- Condensation may form in unheated areas
- Ice may form in flight on cold-soaked structure
- Drainage design prevents water accumulation
- Moisture barrier protects internal structure

## Pressure Altitude Limits
- **Maximum Operating Altitude:** 43,000 ft
- **Maximum Cabin Altitude:** 8,000 ft
- **Differential Pressure:** 8.5 psi normal, 9.1 psi maximum

## Environmental Testing Requirements
See DATA_53-14-02_Environmental-Test-Reqs.csv for detailed test requirements.

### Qualification Testing
1. **Temperature Cycling:**
   - -55°C to +85°C
   - 1000 cycles minimum
   - Combined with mechanical loading

2. **Humidity Exposure:**
   - 85% RH at 70°C
   - 5000 hours minimum
   - Measure property retention

3. **Moisture Absorption:**
   - Immersion in water
   - Measure saturation level
   - Verify <5% property degradation

4. **Freeze-Thaw Cycling:**
   - -55°C to +25°C
   - 100 cycles minimum
   - Verify no delamination

## In-Service Monitoring

### Temperature Monitoring
- Thermocouples in critical areas
- Data logging during flight
- Extreme temperature alert system

### Moisture Monitoring
- Visual inspection for water intrusion
- Moisture meters for spot checks
- Drainage system inspection

## Maintenance Temperature Requirements

### Hangar Temperature
- **Preferred:** 18-25°C (65-77°F)
- **Minimum:** 10°C (50°F) for structural work
- **Maximum:** 35°C (95°F)

### Adhesive Cure Temperature
- **Room Temperature Cure:** 20-25°C for 24-48 hours
- **Elevated Temperature Cure:** 120°C for 90 minutes (autoclave or oven)
- **Heat Blanket Cure:** 80°C for 4 hours (for large area repairs)

## Special Environmental Considerations

### Desert Operations
- High temperature and UV exposure
- Sand and dust contamination
- Thermal cycling (day/night)
- **Precautions:** Frequent inspection of seals, LSP, and coatings

### Maritime Operations
- Salt spray exposure
- High humidity
- Corrosion of metallic fittings
- **Precautions:** Wash with fresh water, corrosion protection maintenance

### Arctic Operations
- Extreme cold temperatures
- Ice and snow accumulation
- Reduced material fracture toughness
- **Precautions:** Warm structure before operation, ice removal procedures

## Documentation
Record environmental conditions for:
- All structural repairs (ambient temperature during cure)
- Pressure tests (temperature affects readings)
- NDT inspections (temperature affects equipment calibration)
- Material storage (temperature excursions)
