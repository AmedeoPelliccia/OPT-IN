**Document ID:** PROC_56-02-02  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-10-27

## Scope
Procedure for removal and replacement of aircraft window panes.

## Safety Warnings
⚠️ **WARNING:** Window removal may cause sudden cabin depressurization if aircraft is pressurized.
⚠️ **CAUTION:** Glass and acrylic panes are fragile. Use proper handling techniques.

## Tools Required
- Torque wrench (0-50 Nm range), calibrated
- Seal cutter tool (P/N TOOL-56-001)
- Pane removal fixture (P/N TOOL-56-010)
- Clean lint-free cloths
- Isopropyl alcohol (IPA)

## Materials Required
- Replacement pane (per AMM)
- Seal kit (per AMM)
- Sealant (per DATA_56-03-03)

## Procedure

### 1. Preparation
1.1. Ensure aircraft is depressurized and electrical power is OFF.
1.2. Remove cabin interior panels as required for access.
1.3. Disconnect heater power supply (if equipped).
1.4. Photograph existing installation for reference.

### 2. Seal Removal
2.1. Using seal cutter tool, carefully cut existing seal.
2.2. Remove fasteners in sequence per drawing (typically star pattern).
2.3. Store fasteners for inspection.

### 3. Pane Removal
3.1. Install pane removal fixture to prevent pane from falling.
3.2. Remove remaining fasteners.
3.3. Carefully lift pane using fixture. Support at all times.
3.4. Place pane in protective storage or disposal bin.

### 4. Frame Inspection
4.1. Inspect frame for cracks, corrosion, damage.
4.2. Clean frame surface with IPA.
4.3. Verify frame flatness per drawing tolerance.

### 5. New Pane Installation
5.1. Remove protective film from new pane.
5.2. Inspect new pane for damage, defects.
5.3. Verify serial number matches work order.
5.4. Apply sealant per DATA_56-03-03 cure schedule.
5.5. Position pane in frame using alignment pins.

### 6. Fastener Installation
6.1. Install fasteners hand-tight in star pattern.
6.2. Torque fasteners to specification per DATA_56-06-03.
6.3. Verify uniform seal compression.

### 7. Electrical Connection (if equipped)
7.1. Connect heater power leads per wiring diagram.
7.2. Verify heater continuity per PROC_56-04-02.

### 8. Final Inspection
8.1. Perform visual inspection for proper seating.
8.2. Check seal for extrusion uniformity.
8.3. Perform leak check (if pressurization test available).
8.4. Perform optical quality check per PROC_56-05-01.

### 9. Documentation
9.1. Record pane serial number in aircraft logbook.
9.2. Complete work order with torque values and inspection results.
9.3. Generate repair record per schema repair-record.schema.json.
