# PROC_56-09-01: LSP Restoration and Continuity Test

**Document ID:** PROC_56-09-01  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  

## Lightning Strike Protection Restoration
### Conductive Coating Damage
1. Clean damaged area
2. Apply conductive coating repair material (ITO or equivalent)
3. Cure per specification
4. Test continuity per procedure below

### Metal Mesh Damage
- **Not repairable** — Replace pane

## 4-Wire Continuity Test Procedure
1. Use 4-wire Kelvin method (eliminates lead resistance)
2. Place current source leads at bonding points
3. Place voltage sense leads adjacent to current leads
4. Apply test current (typically 10 A)
5. Measure voltage drop
6. Calculate resistance: R = V / I

## Acceptance Criteria
- **Continuity Resistance:** < 0.003 Ω between bonding points
- **Coating Sheet Resistance:** 1-10 Ω/square (typical for ITO)

## Test Equipment
- 4-wire milliohm meter or
- Precision DMM with separate current source
