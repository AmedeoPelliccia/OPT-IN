# DESC_56-06-01: Window Load Path and Attachment

**Document ID:** DESC_56-06-01  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  

## Structural Load Path
### Primary Loads
1. **Cabin Pressurization:** 8.6 psi differential pressure
2. **Aerodynamic:** Airflow pressure distribution
3. **Thermal:** Thermal expansion differential
4. **Impact:** Bird strike (4 lb @ 250 KEAS for windshields)

### Load Transfer
1. Pane → Seal → Frame → Fasteners → Fuselage Structure
2. Frame distributes loads to reinforced fuselage cutout
3. Cutout reinforcement ties into primary fuselage frames

## Attachment Methods
- **Windshields:** Bolted frame with torque-critical fasteners
- **Cabin Windows:** Compression gasket with retaining clips
- **Emergency Exit Windows:** Quick-release with structural retention

## Design Margins
- Ultimate Pressure: 1.5 × Design Pressure
- Bird Strike: No penetration, post-impact visibility maintained
