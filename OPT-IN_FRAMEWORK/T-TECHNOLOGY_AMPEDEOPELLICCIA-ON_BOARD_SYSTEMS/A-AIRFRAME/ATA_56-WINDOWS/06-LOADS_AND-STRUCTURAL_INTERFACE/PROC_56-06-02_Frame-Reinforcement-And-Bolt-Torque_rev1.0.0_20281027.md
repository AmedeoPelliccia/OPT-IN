# PROC_56-06-02: Frame Reinforcement and Bolt Torque

**Document ID:** PROC_56-06-02  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  

## Fastener Installation
1. Use calibrated torque wrench (Â± 3% accuracy)
2. Apply anti-seize compound per ATA 20 standards
3. Torque in star pattern from center outward
4. Perform torque retention check after 24 hours
5. Acceptance: > 85% of initial torque retained

## Torque Values
- Per DATA_56-06-03 specific to fastener size and location
- Do not exceed maximum torque (may crack pane)

## Frame Reinforcement
- Required if cutout modified or damage exceeds limits
- Refer to ATA 51 for composite doubler procedures
- FEA analysis required for structural modifications
