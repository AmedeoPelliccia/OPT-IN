# Procedure: 51-03-01 - Bolted Repair for Metallic Structure
**Revision:** 1.0.0

## 1. Purpose
This procedure defines the standard methodology for bolted doubler repairs of metallic (aluminum alloy) aircraft structure.

## 2. Applicability
- Repair of cracks, corrosion damage, and dents in aluminum alloy structure
- Reinforcement of areas with reduced cross-section
- Applicable to non-pressurized and pressurized structure (with appropriate analysis)

## 3. Prerequisites
- **Personnel:** Minimum Level 2 certification per `STD_51-00-03`
- **Damage Assessment:** Complete per `PROC_51-01-02` and classified as "Repairable"
- **Engineering Approval:** If damage is near "Requires Disposition" limits, obtain engineering concurrence

## 4. Materials and Tools
- Doubler material: 2024-T3 or 7075-T6 aluminum alloy sheet (per engineering drawing)
- Fasteners: Hi-Lok or Hi-Tigue fasteners per `DATA_51-06-02` (fastener substitution table)
- Sealant: PR-1440 or equivalent (for fuel-wetted areas) per `DATA_51-06-01`
- Cleaning solvent: MEK or approved equivalent
- Tools: Drill motor, reamers, rivet squeezers, torque wrench, edge distance gauge

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1 Damage Removal (if applicable)
1. If crack is present, stop-drill both ends with 3.2 mm (1/8") drill
2. If corrosion is present, remove to clean metal:
   - Use Scotch-Brite pad or fine abrasive (220 grit)
   - Blend out edges smoothly (minimum blend radius: 10× depth)
   - Clean with solvent and inspect for complete corrosion removal
3. Verify remaining material thickness is ≥80% of original (if less, increase doubler thickness per engineering)

### 5.2 Doubler Fabrication
1. Cut doubler from approved sheet stock
2. Dimensions:
   - Overlap damage by minimum 40 mm on all sides (or 2× fastener spacing, whichever is greater)
   - Radius all corners (minimum R = 6 mm) to avoid stress concentrations
3. Drill fastener holes using drill template or CNC:
   - Hole spacing: 4× fastener diameter (typical)
   - Edge distance: Minimum 2.5× fastener diameter from doubler edge
   - Edge distance from skin edge: Minimum 2.0× fastener diameter
4. Deburr all holes and edges
5. Mark doubler orientation and position on skin

### 5.3 Installation
1. **Surface Preparation:**
   - Clean mating surfaces with MEK
   - Scotch-Brite contact area (circular motion, light pressure)
   - Re-clean with MEK and allow to dry
   - Apply conversion coating (Alodine 1200 or equivalent) if required by repair spec

2. **Sealant Application (if required):**
   - Apply thin coat of sealant to faying surface of doubler
   - Apply small amount around each fastener hole (fay seal)

3. **Positioning:**
   - Clamp doubler to skin using spring clamps or Clecos
   - Verify alignment with marked position
   - Transfer-drill holes through skin (if not already drilled)

4. **Fastener Installation:**
   - Install fasteners from outside skin (head on skin side, collar on doubler side)
   - Follow torque values from `DATA_51-06-02` or ATA 20 torque tables
   - Install in pattern: center outward to avoid trapped air
   - Verify proper grip length (1-2 threads protruding from collar)

5. **Sealant Cleanup:**
   - Wipe excess sealant from edges
   - Allow sealant to cure per manufacturer's data sheet (typically 24-48 hours at room temperature)

### 5.4 Quality Control
1. Visual inspection:
   - All fasteners seated flush (no gaps)
   - No damage to skin or doubler around fastener holes
   - Sealant fillet present (if applicable)
2. Torque check: Sample 10% of fasteners (minimum 3)
3. Eddy current or dye penetrant inspection around stop-drill holes (if crack was present)

## 6. Acceptance Criteria (from `DATA_51-06-03`)
- Fastener installation per ATA 20 workmanship standards
- No cracks emanating from fastener holes
- Doubler fits flush to skin (max gap: 0.5 mm; shim if needed)
- Sealant coverage: 100% of faying surface (no voids visible)

## 7. Documentation
Record in repair record:
- Doubler material specification and batch number
- Fastener part numbers and quantities
- Sealant batch number and expiry date
- Torque values applied
- Technician ID and completion date
- Post-repair inspection results

## 8. Protective Finish
After repair acceptance:
1. Apply corrosion inhibitor (LPS-3 or equivalent) to exposed fasteners
2. Touch up primer and paint per aircraft paint scheme
