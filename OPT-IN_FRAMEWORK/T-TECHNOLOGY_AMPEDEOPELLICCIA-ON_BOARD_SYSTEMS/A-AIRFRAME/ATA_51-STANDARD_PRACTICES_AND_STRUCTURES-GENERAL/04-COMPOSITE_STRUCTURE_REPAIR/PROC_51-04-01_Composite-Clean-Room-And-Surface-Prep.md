# Procedure: 51-04-01 - Composite Clean Room and Surface Prep
**Revision:** 1.0.0

## 1. Purpose
This procedure defines the requirements for composite repair clean room environment and surface preparation, which are critical to achieving airworthy composite repairs.

## 2. Applicability
All composite repairs performed on AMPEL360 aircraft, including:
- Wet layup repairs
- Pre-preg repairs
- Hot-bonded scarf repairs
- Honeycomb core repairs

## 3. Clean Room Requirements

### 3.1 Environmental Controls
- **Temperature:** 18-25°C (65-77°F), controlled to ±3°C
- **Humidity:** 30-60% relative humidity
- **Cleanliness:** ISO Class 8 (100,000) or better (per ISO 14644-1)
- **Air Changes:** Minimum 20 air changes per hour with HEPA filtration
- **Positive Pressure:** Maintain 5-10 Pa positive pressure relative to adjacent areas

### 3.2 Access Control
- Dedicated entry/exit with gowning area
- Personnel must wear:
  - Clean room smock or Tyvek suit
  - Hair covering (bouffant cap)
  - Shoe covers or dedicated clean room shoes
  - Nitrile gloves (powder-free)
- No food, drink, or cosmetics allowed
- Personal belongings stored outside clean room

### 3.3 Material and Tool Control
- All materials enter through material airlock
- Tools and consumables cleaned with IPA (isopropyl alcohol) before entry
- Vacuum cleaner: HEPA-filtered, dedicated to clean room
- Cleaning materials: Lint-free wipes only (Kimwipes or equivalent)

### 3.4 Monitoring and Documentation
- Temperature and humidity logged continuously (datalogger or manual every 4 hours)
- Particle count measured weekly (or more frequently if contamination suspected)
- Environmental data archived with repair records

## 4. Surface Preparation Procedure

### 4.1 Damage Removal (for Scarf Repairs)
1. **Mark Repair Area:**
   - Outline damage boundary with marker
   - Add scarf taper zone (typical taper ratio: 20:1 to 50:1, per engineering)

2. **Abrasive Removal:**
   - Use rotary sander with vacuum shroud (80-120 grit)
   - Remove one ply at a time; inspect frequently to avoid over-sanding
   - Create smooth taper; no steps between plies
   - Final ply should be sanded to create 25-50 mm feathered edge

3. **Damage Verification:**
   - Inspect sanded area under good lighting
   - Perform tap test or C-Scan to verify all damage removed
   - If subsurface damage found, extend scarf and re-inspect

### 4.2 Surface Cleaning
1. **Initial Cleaning:**
   - Vacuum sanded area thoroughly (HEPA vacuum)
   - Wipe with dry lint-free cloth to remove residual dust

2. **Solvent Cleaning (Critical Step):**
   - Wet lint-free wipe with MEK (methyl ethyl ketone) or acetone
   - Wipe surface in one direction (do not wipe back and forth)
   - Discard wipe after each pass; use fresh wipe for next pass
   - Repeat minimum 3 times or until wipe remains clean
   - Allow solvent to evaporate completely (5-10 minutes)

3. **Final Cleaning (Abrasion):**
   - Lightly abrade surface with Scotch-Brite pad (maroon or grey)
   - Circular motion, light pressure
   - Creates micro-roughness for mechanical bonding
   - Re-vacuum to remove abraded particles
   - Perform final solvent wipe (MEK or acetone, same technique as above)

### 4.3 Surface Verification
1. **Water Break Test:**
   - Spray or wipe surface with distilled water
   - Water should form continuous film (no beading)
   - If water beads, repeat cleaning steps
   - Dry with compressed air (oil-free) or lint-free wipe

2. **Timing:**
   - Apply first ply within 4 hours of final cleaning
   - If exceeded, repeat abrasion and cleaning steps

## 5. Contamination Prevention

### 5.1 Common Contaminants
- Skin oils (always wear gloves)
- Mold release agents (from tooling)
- Silicone (from sealants, polishes)
- Moisture (control humidity, avoid wet hands)

### 5.2 If Contamination Suspected
- Re-clean with MEK (minimum 5 wipes)
- Consider using Pasa-Jell 107 (solvent gel) for stubborn contamination
- Allow 24-hour dry-out period if excessive moisture present

## 6. Special Considerations

### 6.1 Honeycomb Core Exposure
- Core cells must be cleaned and dried
- Inject dry nitrogen into cells or use vacuum drying
- Seal cells with film adhesive or potting compound before overwrap

### 6.2 Co-Cured Repairs
- Both mating surfaces (skin and patch) must be prepared per this procedure
- Mate surfaces within 4 hours of preparation

### 6.3 Lightning Strike Protection (LSP) Areas
- Do not damage existing LSP mesh
- If mesh damaged, plan for LSP restoration per `PROC_51-05-01`

## 7. Quality Assurance
- Clean room certification: Annual by certified HVAC contractor
- Environmental monitoring data reviewed weekly by QA
- Surface preparation witnessed by inspector (sample 20% of repairs)

## 8. Cross-References
- `PROC_51-04-02`: Composite Scarf Repair (uses this surface prep)
- `PROC_51-05-01`: Lightning Strike Protection Repair
- `DATA_51-06-01`: Material specifications (solvents, abrasives)
- ISO 14644-1: Clean room classification
