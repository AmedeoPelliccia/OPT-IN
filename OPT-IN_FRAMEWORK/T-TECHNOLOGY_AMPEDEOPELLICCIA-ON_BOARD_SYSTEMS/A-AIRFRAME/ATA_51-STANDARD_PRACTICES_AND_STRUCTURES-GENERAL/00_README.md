# ATA 51: Standard Practices and Structures - General (SRM Foundation)

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** This chapter contains procedures for the repair of primary and secondary aircraft structure. Incorrect assessment or repair can lead to catastrophic structural failure. These procedures must be performed by certified structural repair technicians.

## Scope & Governance
This chapter serves as the foundation for the Structural Repair Manual (SRM). It provides the general engineering principles, damage classification, and methodologies for all structural repairs.

- **Zero Deviation:** All repairs must follow the methodologies herein. Any deviation, or damage exceeding "repairable" limits, requires a formal Engineering Disposition.
- **Qualification:** All standard repairs are substantiated by coupon, element, or full-scale testing as defined in the Qualification Matrix.
- **Traceability:** Every repair requires a complete, auditable Repair Record, linking materials, processes, personnel, and NDT results.

## Damage Classification & Repair Workflow

    A[Damage Discovered] --> B{Assess Damage};
    B --> C{Is it Negligible? per DATA_51-01-01_Damage-Classification-Limits.csv};
    C -- Yes --> D[Record in Log & Blend Out];
    C -- No --> E{Is it Repairable? per DATA_51-01-01_Damage-Classification-Limits.csv};
    E -- Yes --> F[Perform Standard Repair per ATA 51-57];
    F --> G[Complete Repair Record & Post-Repair NDT];
    G --> H[Return to Service];
    E -- No --> I[Raise Nonconformance Report];
    I --> J{Obtain OEM Engineering Disposition};
    J --> K[Major Repair or Replace Component];
    K --> G;
```

## Key Cross-References
- **ATA 04:** Defines mandatory structural inspections (ALS) that may be initiated post-repair.
- **ATA 20:** Provides the basic workmanship standards (e.g., fastener torquing) used to execute repairs.
- **ATA 53-57:** Contain specific, pre-approved repair procedures for various locations, based on the methods defined in this chapter.

## Applicable Standards & Regulations

- AC 43.13-1B
- SAE AIR4844
