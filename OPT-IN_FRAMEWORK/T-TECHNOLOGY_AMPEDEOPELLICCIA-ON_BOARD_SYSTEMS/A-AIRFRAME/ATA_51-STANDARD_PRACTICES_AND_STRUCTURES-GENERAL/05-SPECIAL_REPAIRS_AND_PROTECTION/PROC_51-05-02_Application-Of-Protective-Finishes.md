# Procedure: 51-05-02 - Application of Protective Finishes
**Revision:** 1.0.0

## 1. Purpose
This procedure defines the application of protective finishes (primer, paint, sealants, corrosion inhibitors) following structural repairs.

## 2. Applicability
All structural repairs after completion and acceptance of the primary repair work.

## 3. Prerequisites
- Structural repair complete and accepted
- Post-repair NDT passed (if applicable)
- Surface clean and dry
- Environmental conditions suitable (see Section 5.1)

## 4. Materials and Equipment
- **Primer:** Epoxy primer per aircraft specification (typically MIL-PRF-23377 Type I)
- **Paint:** Polyurethane topcoat per aircraft paint scheme
- **Sealant:** As applicable (PR-1440 for fuel areas, PR-1422 for general use)
- **Corrosion Inhibitor:** LPS-3 or equivalent for exposed fasteners
- **Application Tools:** Spray gun (HVLP preferred), brushes, rags, masking materials
- **PPE:** Respirator (organic vapor cartridge), gloves, eye protection

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1 Environmental Requirements
- **Temperature:** 15-30°C (60-85°F)
- **Humidity:** <85% RH
- **Ventilation:** Adequate ventilation or spray booth with exhaust
- **Surface Temperature:** Must be >5°C above dew point (to prevent moisture condensation)

### 5.2 Surface Preparation
1. **Cleaning:**
   - Wipe surface with clean, lint-free cloth dampened with IPA
   - Allow IPA to evaporate completely (5-10 minutes)
   - For metallic repairs: apply conversion coating (Alodine 1200) if bare metal exposed

2. **Masking:**
   - Mask adjacent areas to protect from overspray
   - Use fine-line tape for precision edges
   - Protect any lightning strike mesh, antennas, or sensors in repair area

### 5.3 Primer Application
1. **Mixing:**
   - Mix primer per manufacturer's instructions (typically 4:1 base:catalyst ratio)
   - Thin if needed for spray application (10-20% by volume)
   - Record batch number and mix date

2. **Application:**
   - Apply 1-2 coats of primer
   - First coat: Light mist coat (to promote adhesion)
   - Second coat: Full wet coat
   - Target dry film thickness (DFT): 25-40 microns (1-1.5 mils)
   - Flash time between coats: 15-30 minutes

3. **Curing:**
   - Allow primer to cure per manufacturer's specification:
     - Room temperature cure: 24 hours minimum
     - Force dry (60°C): 1 hour minimum
   - Verify cure by thumbnail test (should not mark easily)

### 5.4 Topcoat Application
1. **Preparation:**
   - Lightly scuff primer with 400-600 grit (to promote adhesion)
   - Clean with IPA wipe
   - Mix topcoat per manufacturer's instructions

2. **Application:**
   - Apply 2-3 coats of topcoat
   - Target DFT: 50-75 microns (2-3 mils) total
   - Flash time between coats: 10-20 minutes
   - Final coat should be smooth, glossy, uniform color

3. **Curing:**
   - Allow topcoat to cure:
     - Room temperature: 48 hours minimum before service
     - Force dry (60°C): 2 hours minimum

### 5.5 Sealant Application (if required)
1. **Fuel Sealing:**
   - Apply sealant to all fastener heads and faying surfaces in fuel-wetted areas
   - Use sealant per specification (PR-1440 Class B for integral fuel tanks)
   - Apply in continuous bead; tool smooth with spatula

2. **Weather Sealing:**
   - Apply sealant to panel edges, door frames, window perimeters
   - Use PR-1422 or equivalent (general-purpose sealant)

3. **Curing:**
   - Cure per manufacturer's specification (typically 24-72 hours at room temperature)
   - Do not expose to fuel or hydraulic fluid until fully cured

### 5.6 Corrosion Inhibitor (for Fasteners)
1. Apply light coat of LPS-3 to all exposed fastener heads
2. Wipe off excess (thin film only)
3. Reapply every 12 months or per aircraft maintenance schedule

## 6. Quality Control

### 6.1 Visual Inspection
- Paint coverage: 100% (no bare metal or primer showing)
- Surface finish: Smooth, glossy, no runs or sags
- Color match: Within acceptable limits of aircraft paint scheme
- Sealant: Continuous fillet, no voids or gaps

### 6.2 DFT Measurement
- Use magnetic thickness gauge (for metallic substrates) or ultrasonic gauge (for composites)
- Measure minimum 5 points per repair area
- Verify DFT within specification range

### 6.3 Adhesion Test (if required)
- Perform cross-hatch adhesion test per ASTM D3359
- Acceptance: Rating 4B or 5B (no coating removal)

## 7. Documentation
Record in repair record:
- Primer and paint product names, batch numbers, mix ratios
- DFT measurements (average and range)
- Sealant product and batch number
- Application date and environmental conditions (temperature, humidity)
- Technician ID

## 8. Special Considerations

### 8.1 Aircraft in Service (Quick Turnaround)
- Use fast-cure primers and paints (2-hour cure at room temperature)
- May sacrifice some durability for faster return to service

### 8.2 Cold Weather Application
- If temperature <15°C, use heaters to warm surface and air
- Increase cure time by 50-100%

### 8.3 High-Temperature Areas (Near Engines)
- Use high-temperature primers and paints (rated to 250°C)
- Apply thicker DFT for better heat resistance

## 9. Waste Disposal
- Dispose of paint, solvents, and contaminated rags per local environmental regulations
- Do not pour solvents down drain
- Use approved waste containers with proper labeling

## 10. Cross-References
- Aircraft Paint Scheme Specification
- MIL-PRF-23377: Primer specification
- ATA 12: Servicing (includes paint touch-up procedures)
- SDS (Safety Data Sheets) for all materials used
