# Procedure: 50-04-02 - Lubrication of Restraint Locks

**Document ID:** PROC_50-04-02_Lubrication-Of-Restraint-Locks_rev1.0.0_20281004  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-10-04

## 1. Scope
This procedure covers the periodic lubrication of cargo restraint lock mechanisms to ensure smooth operation and prevent corrosion.

## 2. Applicable Aircraft
All AMPEL360 BWB aircraft

## 3. Interval
- Every 1000 flight hours or 12 months, whichever comes first
- After water or de-icing fluid exposure
- As required by inspection findings

## 4. Prerequisites
- Aircraft on ground
- Cargo compartment empty
- Access to all restraint locks

## 5. Required Materials
- Dry lubricant spray (MIL-L-46010)
- Clean, lint-free cloths
- Cleaning solvent (Stoddard solvent or approved equivalent)
- Small brush (nylon bristles)
- Inspection mirror and flashlight

## 6. Safety Precautions
**CAUTION:** Do not use petroleum-based lubricants. They attract dirt and debris which will cause lock mechanisms to jam.

**CAUTION:** Ensure adequate ventilation when using solvents and spray lubricants.

## 7. Procedure

### 7.1 Cleaning
1. **Identify all restraint locks:**
   - Forward cargo compartment: approximately 40 locks
   - Aft cargo compartment: approximately 28 locks
   - Document location of any missing or damaged locks

2. **Clean each lock mechanism:**
   - Open lock fully
   - Brush away loose debris
   - Apply cleaning solvent with cloth
   - Work lock mechanism several times to flush out old lubricant
   - Wipe away excess solvent and debris
   - Allow to dry for 5 minutes

### 7.2 Inspection
While locks are clean and dry, inspect each lock for:
- Cracks or damage to lock body
- Worn or damaged locking pins
- Missing or damaged springs
- Excessive wear in pivot points
- Corrosion beyond limits in SRM 50-04-00

Record any discrepancies. Repair or replace defective locks before proceeding with lubrication.

### 7.3 Lubrication
1. **Apply dry lubricant:**
   - Shake lubricant can thoroughly
   - Hold can 15-20 cm from lock mechanism
   - Spray 2-second burst into:
     - Pivot points
     - Locking pin bore
     - Spring areas
   - Do NOT over-lubricate (excess lubricant attracts debris)

2. **Work mechanism:**
   - Operate lock through full range of motion 10 times
   - Verify smooth operation without binding
   - Lock should engage and release with minimal force

3. **Wipe excess:**
   - Use clean cloth to remove any excess lubricant
   - Ensure no lubricant puddles remain

### 7.4 Functional Test
For each lubricated lock:
1. Open lock fully
2. Insert test pin (or cargo restraint fitting)
3. Close lock - should engage with positive click
4. Apply pull force of approximately 200N (test strap optional)
5. Verify lock holds
6. Release lock - should open smoothly
7. Remove test pin

### 7.5 Documentation
1. Count total number of locks serviced: _____
2. Document number of locks requiring repair: _____
3. Note any compartment areas requiring special attention
4. Record completion on aircraft maintenance log

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
- All locks operate smoothly without binding
- Lock engagement is positive with audible/tactile click
- Locks hold test load without slipping
- No excessive play in lock mechanism
- All springs return lock to open position

## 9. Troubleshooting
| Problem | Possible Cause | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| Lock binds | Dirt in mechanism | Re-clean and lubricate |
| Won't engage | Worn locking pin | Replace lock per AMM 50-04-02 |
| Won't release | Broken spring | Replace lock per AMM 50-04-02 |
| Excessive play | Worn pivot | Replace lock per AMM 50-04-02 |

## 10. Parts Information
- Restraint lock assembly: P/N 50-04-100-01
- Dry lubricant: P/N MIL-L-46010 or equivalent
- Cleaning solvent: Stoddard solvent

## 11. Quality Assurance
- Inspector verification required for C-Check level maintenance
- Photographic documentation required if repairs were performed
- Update component maintenance records

## 12. Environmental Note
Used cleaning cloths and excess lubricant should be disposed of according to local environmental regulations. Do not dispose in regular trash.
