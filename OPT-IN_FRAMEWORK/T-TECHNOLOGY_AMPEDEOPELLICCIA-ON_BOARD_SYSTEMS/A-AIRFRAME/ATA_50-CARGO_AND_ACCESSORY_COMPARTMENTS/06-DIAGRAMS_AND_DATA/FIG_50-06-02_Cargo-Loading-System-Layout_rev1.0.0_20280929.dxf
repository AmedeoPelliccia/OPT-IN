ATA 50: Cargo and Accessory Compartments
Drawing: Cargo Loading System Layout

Revision: 1.0.0
Effective Date: 2028-09-29

This is a placeholder for the actual DXF (Drawing Exchange Format) file that would contain:
- Cargo compartment floor plan with dimensions
- Seat track locations and spacing
- Restraint fitting positions
- Power drive unit locations
- Cargo door interfaces
- Loading equipment clearances
- Reference datums (FS, BL, WL)

The actual DXF file would be created using CAD software such as:
- AutoCAD
- CATIA
- SolidWorks
- or similar professional CAD systems

For implementation in a real aircraft program, this file would be exported from the 
aircraft 3D model and would include multiple layers for different system elements.

Drawing Scale: 1:50
Sheet Size: A0
Projection: Top View (Plan View)
Units: Metric (millimeters)

Note: In a production environment, this would be a binary DXF file, not a text placeholder.
