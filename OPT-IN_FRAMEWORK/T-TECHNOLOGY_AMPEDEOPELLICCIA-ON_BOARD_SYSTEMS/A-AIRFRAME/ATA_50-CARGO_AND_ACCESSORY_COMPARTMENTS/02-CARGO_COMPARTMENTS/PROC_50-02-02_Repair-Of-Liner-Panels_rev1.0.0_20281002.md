# Procedure: 50-02-02 - Repair of Liner Panels

**Document ID:** PROC_50-02-02_Repair-Of-Liner-Panels_rev1.0.0_20281002  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-10-02

## 1. Scope
This procedure covers the removal and replacement of damaged cargo compartment liner panels to maintain fire containment certification.

## 2. Applicable Aircraft
All AMPEL360 BWB aircraft

## 3. Prerequisites
- Aircraft on ground with electrical power OFF
- Cargo compartment empty
- Adequate lighting and ventilation

## 4. Required Tools and Materials
- Standard hand tools per AMM 20-00-00
- Rivet gun and bucking bar
- Liner panel (P/N per IPC 50-02-02)
- High-temperature sealant (P/N AMS-S-8802)
- Safety equipment: gloves, safety glasses

## 5. Safety Precautions
**WARNING:** Liner panels are fire-rated components. Use only approved replacement parts. Improper installation compromises compartment fire certification and may result in catastrophic fire spread.

## 6. Procedure

### 6.1 Removal of Damaged Panel
1. Identify and mark the damaged panel
2. Remove cargo restraint hardware in the work area
3. Drill out rivets securing the damaged panel (typically 24-32 rivets per panel)
4. Carefully remove the panel, noting any sealant application points
5. Clean the mounting surface:
   - Remove old sealant residue
   - Clean with MEK or approved solvent
   - Inspect mounting structure for damage
   - Repair any structural damage per SRM 53-10-00 before proceeding

### 6.2 Installation of New Panel
1. Verify new panel part number matches IPC requirements
2. Trial fit the new panel to ensure proper alignment
3. Apply high-temperature sealant per AMM 20-30-00:
   - 3mm bead along all edges
   - Around all penetrations
4. Position the panel and secure with temporary fasteners
5. Install permanent rivets:
   - Use solid rivets, P/N MS20470AD4-6
   - Rivet spacing: 40mm maximum
   - Ensure proper shop head formation
6. Remove temporary fasteners and install remaining rivets
7. Verify all rivets are properly formed and flush

### 6.3 Sealing
1. Apply additional sealant to all rivet heads
2. Seal any gaps between panel edges
3. Smooth sealant with approved tool
4. Allow sealant to cure per manufacturer specifications (minimum 24 hours)

### 6.4 Reinstallation of Restraint Hardware
1. Reinstall cargo restraint fittings per original configuration
2. Torque fasteners to values specified in AMM 50-04-00
3. Safety-wire as required

## 7. Inspection and Test
1. Visual inspection:
   - All rivets properly formed
   - No gaps in sealant
   - Panel flush with adjacent panels
2. Tap test for secure attachment
3. Record work on aircraft log

## 8. Quality Assurance
- Inspector signature required
- Photographs of completed work required
- Update aircraft maintenance records

## 9. Return to Service
Aircraft may return to service after:
- Completion of all work steps
- QA inspection and sign-off
- Sealant cure time elapsed (24 hours minimum)
