**Document ID:** INSP_50-03-01_Inspection-Avionics-Bay_rev1.0.0_20281003  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-10-03

## 1. Scope
This inspection covers the periodic inspection of the avionics bay (Zone 151) to ensure proper cooling, mounting security, and environmental protection of avionics equipment.

## 2. Interval
- **A-Check:** Visual inspection through access panels
- **C-Check:** Detailed inspection with equipment access

## 3. Access Requirements
- Aircraft electrical power OFF (unless specific system test required)
- Forward avionics bay access panels removed
- Adequate lighting (minimum 500 lux)
- ESD precautions in effect

## 4. Safety Precautions
**WARNING:** Avionics equipment is sensitive to electrostatic discharge (ESD). Use proper ESD protection including wrist straps and ESD-safe tools.

**CAUTION:** Some equipment may have stored electrical energy. Verify power is OFF and wait appropriate discharge time before handling.

## 5. Inspection Areas

### 5.1 Environmental Control
- Cooling air distribution ducts
- Temperature sensors and monitoring
- Humidity indicators
- Ventilation fan operation

### 5.2 Equipment Mounting
- Rack attachment security
- Equipment module retention
- Shock mount condition
- Bonding straps and grounding

### 5.3 Compartment Structure
- Access panel condition
- Seal integrity
- Drain holes and moisture protection
- Cable routing and support

### 5.4 Fire Protection
- Smoke detector installation and condition
- Fire containment barriers
- Wiring insulation integrity

## 6. Inspection Procedure

### 6.1 General Visual Inspection
1. Remove access panels per AMM 50-03-00
2. Perform general visual inspection:
   - Check for FOD
   - Look for signs of moisture or condensation
   - Check for unusual odors or discoloration
   - Verify no loose hardware or components

### 6.2 Environmental System Inspection
1. **Cooling system:**
   - Inspect air distribution ducts for damage or blockage
   - Verify duct connections are secure
   - Check cooling fan operation (power required)
   - Verify temperature within limits (15-35Â°C)

2. **Moisture control:**
   - Check drain holes are clear
   - Verify no standing water
   - Check humidity indicators (should be blue, not pink)
   - Inspect seals around access panels

### 6.3 Equipment Mounting Inspection
1. **Racks and chassis:**
   - Verify all mounting fasteners are secure
   - Check for proper torque (if torque seal broken)
   - Inspect shock mounts for deterioration
   - Verify equipment is fully seated in connectors

2. **Bonding and grounding:**
   - Check bonding straps for security and condition
   - Verify no corrosion at bonding points
   - Test bonding resistance if required (< 0.001 ohm)

### 6.4 Cable and Connector Inspection
1. Inspect cable bundles for:
   - Proper routing and support
   - Chafing or damage to insulation
   - Security of tie-wraps and clamps
   - Clearance from sharp edges or hot surfaces

2. Inspect connectors for:
   - Security of attachment
   - Condition of connector shells
   - Proper safety-wiring
   - No bent or damaged pins (if visible)

## 7. Functional Tests
If required by maintenance schedule:
1. Cooling fan operation test
2. Temperature monitoring system test
3. Smoke detector functional test (per PROC_50-05-02)

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
- All equipment securely mounted
- No signs of overheating or moisture damage
- All bonding straps secure and intact
- Cooling system operational and within temperature limits
- No corrosion exceeding allowable limits
- All fasteners secure and safety-wired as required

## 9. Documentation
Record findings on Form ATA50-INSP-03. Photograph any discrepancies.

## 10. Corrective Actions
| Finding | Action | Reference |
|---------|--------|-----------|
| Overtemperature | Check cooling system per AMM 21-50-00 | ATA 21 |
| Moisture present | Check drain system, replace desiccant | AMM 50-03-02 |
| Loose equipment | Torque and safety as required | AMM 50-03-01 |
| Damaged cable | Repair or replace per AMM 20-10-00 | ATA 20 |

## 11. Return to Service
1. Reinstall all access panels
2. Verify panel attachment and sealing
3. Update maintenance records
4. Inspector sign-off required
