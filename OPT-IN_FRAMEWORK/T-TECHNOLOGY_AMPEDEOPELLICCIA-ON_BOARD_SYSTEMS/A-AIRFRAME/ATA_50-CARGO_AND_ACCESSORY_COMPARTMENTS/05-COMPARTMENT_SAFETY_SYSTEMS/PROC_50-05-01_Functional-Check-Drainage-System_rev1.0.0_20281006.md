# Procedure: 50-05-01 - Functional Check of Drainage System

**Document ID:** PROC_50-05-01_Functional-Check-Drainage-System_rev1.0.0_20281006  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Scope
This procedure covers the functional check of cargo compartment drainage systems to ensure proper water removal and prevent moisture accumulation.

## 2. Applicable Aircraft
All AMPEL360 BWB aircraft

## 3. Interval
- Every C-Check
- After heavy rain or water ingress event
- After compartment washing
- As required by inspection findings

## 4. Prerequisites
- Aircraft on ground with level attitude (within ±2°)
- Cargo compartments empty
- Access to drain outlets (external)

## 5. Required Materials
- Water (potable quality, minimum 20 liters)
- Graduated container (5 liter capacity)
- Stopwatch
- Inspection mirror and flashlight
- Drain cleaning tools (flexible rod, compressed air)

## 6. Safety Precautions
**CAUTION:** Do not introduce excessive water. Use only the specified test quantities to avoid damage to equipment or structure.

**CAUTION:** Ensure all drain water is collected and disposed of properly. Do not allow water to enter avionics compartments.

## 7. Procedure

### 7.1 Pre-Test Inspection
1. **Identify all drain locations:**
   - Forward cargo compartment: 4 drains (2 port, 2 starboard)
   - Aft cargo compartment: 3 drains (1 port, 1 starboard, 1 centerline)
   
2. **Visual inspection:**
   - Inspect each drain inlet for blockage or debris
   - Check drain grating is secure and undamaged
   - Verify drain lines are properly connected (external inspection)
   - Check drain outlet is clear (external inspection)

3. **Document drain condition:**
   - Note any visible blockage
   - Record any damage to drain components
   - Photograph any discrepancies

### 7.2 Drain Flow Test - Forward Compartment

#### Port Side Drains
1. **Test Drain #1 (forward-most position):**
   - Position collection container under external drain outlet
   - Pour 3 liters of water into drain inlet
   - Start stopwatch
   - Observe water flow at outlet
   - Record time for water to begin flowing: _____ seconds (spec: < 30 sec)
   - Record time for complete drainage: _____ seconds (spec: < 120 sec)
   - Measure water collected: _____ liters (should be ≥ 2.7L, allowing for evaporation)

2. **Test Drain #2 (aft position):**
   - Repeat steps above for second port drain
   - Record all measurements

#### Starboard Side Drains
3. Repeat test procedure for both starboard drains
4. Record all measurements on Form ATA50-DRAIN-01

### 7.3 Drain Flow Test - Aft Compartment
1. Repeat test procedure for all three aft compartment drains
2. Note: Centerline drain may have slower flow due to longer drain line (< 180 sec acceptable)

### 7.4 Blockage Clearing (if required)
If any drain fails flow test:

1. **Attempt clearing from top:**
   - Insert flexible cleaning rod into drain inlet
   - Work rod through drain line to dislodge blockage
   - Flush with 1 liter water
   - Re-test

2. **If still blocked, clear from bottom:**
   - Access external drain outlet
   - Insert cleaning rod from bottom
   - Flush with compressed air (max 40 psi)
   - Re-test from top

3. **If blockage persists:**
   - Drain line may require removal and cleaning
   - Refer to AMM 50-05-02 for drain line removal
   - Consider possibility of frozen drain (check temperature)

### 7.5 Standing Water Check
1. After all drains tested and clear:
   - Inspect all low points in compartment floors
   - Use flashlight and mirror to check hidden areas
   - Verify no standing water remains
   - If water found, investigate drainage path and re-clean drains

## 8. Acceptance Criteria
- Water begins flowing within 30 seconds (180 sec for aft centerline)
- Complete drainage within 120 seconds (180 sec for aft centerline)
- Minimum 90% of introduced water recovered
- No standing water in compartment after test
- All drain inlets and outlets clear and undamaged

## 9. Test Results Summary
| Drain Location | Flow Start (sec) | Complete Drain (sec) | Water Recovered (L) | Pass/Fail |
|----------------|------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| FWD Port #1 | | | | |
| FWD Port #2 | | | | |
| FWD Stbd #1 | | | | |
| FWD Stbd #2 | | | | |
| AFT Port | | | | |
| AFT Stbd | | | | |
| AFT Center | | | | |

## 10. Troubleshooting
| Problem | Possible Cause | Action |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| No flow | Complete blockage | Clear drain per 7.4 |
| Slow flow | Partial blockage | Clear drain per 7.4 |
| Water remains | Blocked drain or aircraft not level | Check level, clear drains |
| External leak | Damaged drain line | Replace drain line per AMM 50-05-02 |

## 11. Documentation
1. Complete Form ATA50-DRAIN-01
2. Record pass/fail for each drain
3. Document any corrective actions taken
4. Update aircraft maintenance records
5. Inspector sign-off required
