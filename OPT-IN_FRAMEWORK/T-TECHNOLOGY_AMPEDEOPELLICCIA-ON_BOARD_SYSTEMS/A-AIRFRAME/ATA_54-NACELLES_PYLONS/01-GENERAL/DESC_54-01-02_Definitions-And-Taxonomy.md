# DESC 54-01-02: Definitions and Taxonomy

## Purpose
This document establishes standard terminology and classification systems for nacelles and pylons used throughout ATA 54.

## Key Definitions

### Nacelle
The streamlined housing around an aircraft engine, comprising:
- **Fan Cowl:** Forward section enclosing the fan/propulsor
- **Core Cowl:** Aft section enclosing the engine core
- **Access Panels:** Removable sections for maintenance access
- **Acoustic Panels:** Noise-attenuating liner elements

### Pylon
The primary structural member that:
- Connects the engine to the airframe
- Transmits thrust, drag, and inertial loads
- Provides conduit routing for fuel, air, electrical, and hydraulic systems
- Maintains proper engine alignment and clearances

### Engine Mount
The interface hardware between engine and pylon, consisting of:
- **Forward Mount:** Carries vertical and side loads
- **Aft Mount:** Carries thrust loads and provides torque restraint
- **Failsafe Design:** Redundant load paths per certification requirements

### Thrust Reverser
Mechanism that redirects engine exhaust to provide braking force:
- **Cascade Type:** Uses fixed vanes and translating cowls
- **Target Type:** Uses deflector doors (if applicable)

## Component Taxonomy

### Nacelle Zones
- **Zone 100:** Fan cowl assembly
- **Zone 200:** Core cowl assembly
- **Zone 300:** Thrust reverser assembly
- **Zone 400:** Acoustic treatment panels
- **Zone 500:** Aerodynamic fairings

### Pylon Stations
Stations measured from aircraft fuselage datum:
- **Station Reference:** Per ATA 06 dimensional data
- **Forward Attach:** Primary structural interface to wing/fuselage
- **Aft Attach:** Secondary structural interface

### Load Path Classification
- **Primary Structure:** Failure causes loss of engine or structural collapse
- **Secondary Structure:** Supports primary structure; failure degrades performance
- **Tertiary Structure:** Aerodynamic or protective; failure does not affect structural integrity

## Damage Classification
Per `/schemas/damage-classification.schema.json`:
- **Minor:** Cosmetic or non-structural; repair per AMM
- **Major:** Structural damage within SRM limits; requires engineering review
- **Critical:** Damage exceeding SRM limits; requires Engineering Disposition

## Material Codes
- **CFRP:** Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer
- **GFRP:** Glass Fiber Reinforced Polymer
- **Al-7075:** Aluminum alloy 7075-T6
- **Ti-6Al-4V:** Titanium alloy Grade 5
- **Inconel-718:** Nickel-based superalloy for high-temperature areas

## Standard Abbreviations
- **BWB:** Blended Wing Body
- **ED:** Engineering Disposition
- **FBO:** Fan Blade Out
- **GVI:** General Visual Inspection
- **LSP:** Lightning Strike Protection
- **M&P:** Materials and Processes
- **NDT:** Non-Destructive Testing
- **SRM:** Structural Repair Manual
