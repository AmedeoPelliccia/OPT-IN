# DESC 54-01-01: Scope, Governance, and Effectivity

## Purpose
This document defines the scope, governance structure, and applicability (effectivity) of ATA 54 - Nacelles & Pylons for the AMPEL360 aircraft program.

## Scope
ATA 54 encompasses all structural, mechanical, and integrated system aspects of:
- **Nacelle assemblies:** Including fan cowls, core cowls, access panels, acoustic treatments, and aerodynamic fairings
- **Engine mounting pylons:** Primary load-bearing structures connecting engines to the airframe
- **Engine mount fittings:** Failsafe attachment hardware
- **Thrust reverser systems:** Actuation, doors, and structural elements
- **Integrated pass-throughs:** For fuel, hydraulics, pneumatics, electrical, and control routing

## Governance

### Ownership
**Primary Owner:** Propulsion Integration Engineering  
**Co-Owners:** Structures Engineering, Systems Integration

### Review and Approval Authority
All procedures, repairs, and modifications within ATA 54 require review and approval from:
1. **Structures Authority** - For all structural repairs and load-path modifications
2. **Airworthiness Engineering** - For compliance verification
3. **Engine OEM** - For interface modifications affecting engine installation

### Zero Deviation Policy
- All repairs to primary structure (pylon spars, engine mount fittings) must strictly follow approved procedures
- Any deviation requires formal Engineering Disposition (ED)
- Emergency repairs require post-event ED within 72 hours

## Effectivity

### Aircraft Configuration
- **Configuration Block A:** MSN AMP360-001 through AMP360-050
- **Engine Type:** Open-fan propulsor (ATA 71/72)
- **Nacelle Type:** Upper-surface integrated BWB nacelles

### Revision Control
- **Current Revision:** 1.0.0
- **Effective Date:** 2025-10-27
- **Next Scheduled Review:** 2025-10-27
