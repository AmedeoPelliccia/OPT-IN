# PROC 54-04-02: Thrust Reverser Inspection and Functional Test

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure describes the inspection and functional testing of thrust reverser systems.

## Safety Warnings
- **WARNING:** Only perform functional tests with aircraft properly chocked and in safe area
- **CAUTION:** Hydraulic pressure can cause component movement - keep clear of reverser during tests
- **WARNING:** Engine must be shut down and cooled before manual inspection

## Required Tools
- Hydraulic test cart (if aircraft hydraulics not available)
- Inspection mirror and flashlight
- Go/no-go gauges per DATA 54-04-03
- Torque wrench, 0-200 Nm

## Visual Inspection

### External Inspection
1. **Translating Cowl:**
   - Check for cracks, dents, or deformation
   - Verify seal condition
   - Check attachment points

2. **Cascade Vanes:**
   - Inspect for damage, erosion, or distortion
   - Verify all vanes are securely attached
   - Check for FOD damage

3. **Blocker Doors:**
   - Inspect hinge points for wear
   - Check door surfaces for damage
   - Verify seal integrity

### Internal Inspection
4. **Actuators:**
   - Check for hydraulic leaks
   - Inspect rod condition (no scoring or corrosion)
   - Verify attachment hardware is tight

5. **Lock Mechanisms:**
   - Inspect lock hooks for wear or damage
   - Check springs for proper tension
   - Verify lock indicators function correctly

## Functional Test

### Preparation
1. Position aircraft in safe test area
2. Chock all landing gear
3. Verify hydraulic system pressure available
4. Clear all personnel from reverser area

### Deployment Test
1. **Initial Position Check:**
   - Verify reverser in fully stowed position
   - Check stow locks engaged

2. **Deploy Reverser:**
   - Command deployment
   - Monitor deployment time (must be < 3 seconds)
   - Verify smooth, symmetric movement
   - Check for unusual noise or binding

3. **Deployed Position Check:**
   - Verify full deployment (use go/no-go gauges)
   - Check deploy locks engaged
   - Verify position indication correct

### Stow Test
4. **Stow Reverser:**
   - Command stow
   - Monitor stow time (must be < 4 seconds)
   - Verify smooth return to stowed position

5. **Stowed Position Check:**
   - Verify full stow (no gaps visible)
   - Check stow locks engaged
   - Verify position indication correct

### Repeat Test
6. Perform deployment/stow cycle 3 times total
7. Record times and observe for consistency

## Lock Mechanism Test
8. Manually verify lock engagement (engine shut down):
   - Attempt to move cowl with locks engaged (should not move)
   - Check lock clearances per DATA 54-04-03

## Acceptance Criteria
- Deployment time: < 3 seconds
- Stow time: < 4 seconds
- No binding or unusual noise
- Locks engage positively in both positions
- Position indication accurate
- No hydraulic leaks
- Symmetric deployment (left/right comparison if applicable)

## Documentation
- Record all times and observations
- Note any discrepancies
- Photograph any damage found
- Complete maintenance record entry
