# DESC 54-04-01: Thrust Reverser Types and Function

## Overview
The AMPEL360 employs cascade-type thrust reversers on the open-fan propulsors to provide additional braking force during landing and rejected takeoff operations.

## Thrust Reverser Configuration

### Type: Cascade Translating Cowl
- **Mechanism:** Translating sleeves expose cascade vanes
- **Actuation:** Dual hydraulic actuators per reverser
- **Deployment time:** < 3 seconds to full deployment
- **Stow time:** < 4 seconds to full stow

### Major Components
1. **Translating Cowl:** Moves aft to expose cascades
2. **Cascade Vanes:** Fixed turning vanes that redirect airflow
3. **Blocker Doors:** Deploy to block forward thrust path
4. **Hydraulic Actuators:** Dual system for redundancy
5. **Lock Mechanisms:** Mechanical locks in stowed and deployed positions

## Operational Function

### Deployment Sequence
1. Pilot selects reverse thrust
2. Hydraulic system pressure applied to actuators
3. Mechanical locks release
4. Translating cowl moves aft
5. Blocker doors deploy
6. Airflow redirected through cascades (forward and upward)
7. Locks engage in deployed position

### Stow Sequence
1. Pilot deselects reverse thrust
2. Hydraulic pressure reversed
3. Blocker doors retract
4. Translating cowl moves forward
5. Locks engage in stowed position

## Safety Features

### Interlock Systems
- Ground sensing logic prevents in-flight deployment
- Thrust lever position interlocks
- Hydraulic pressure monitoring
- Position indication and feedback

### Redundancy
- Dual hydraulic actuators (either can deploy reverser)
- Mechanical backup locks
- Independent control channels

## Performance Characteristics
- **Maximum reverse thrust:** ~50% of forward thrust
- **Effectiveness:** 25-30% reduction in landing roll
- **Noise impact:** +15 dB during deployment

## Maintenance Philosophy
- **Actuators:** On-condition monitoring
- **Locks:** Functional test every 500 FH
- **Cascade vanes:** Visual inspection every C-check
- **Blocker doors:** Detailed inspection per ATA 05
