**Revision:** 1.0.0

## 1. Critical Safety Warning
- **Hazard:** Engine drop. The engine must be supported by a certified engine stand/sling per ATA 71 before any mount bolts are loosened.
- **Hazard:** High torque. Use of calibrated, high-capacity torque wrenches is mandatory.

## 2. Inspection (On-Wing)
1.  **Visual Inspection:** Clean and visually inspect all engine mount fittings for cracks, corrosion, and fretting.
2.  **NDT:** Perform an Eddy Current inspection on the lug holes of each fitting per `PROC_54-07-03`.
3.  **Acceptance:** Any crack indication is cause for immediate component replacement.

## 3. Replacement Procedure
1.  **Support Engine:** Securely support the engine using approved GSE per ATA 71.
2.  **Remove Bolts:** Sequentially remove the engine mount bolts. Discard all bolts, nuts, and washers; they are single-use.
3.  **Remove Fitting:** Remove the unserviceable fitting.
4.  **Install New Fitting:** Install the new fitting, ensuring all mating surfaces are clean.
5.  **Install New Hardware:** Install new bolts, nuts, and washers.
6.  **Torqueing:** Torque all bolts to the value specified in `DATA_54-03-04` using a calibrated torque wrench. This is a multi-stage torque procedure.
7.  **Remove Support:** Once all bolts are torqued and inspected, remove the engine support GSE.
