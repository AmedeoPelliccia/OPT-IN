# PROC 54-02-02: Fan Cowl Removal and Installation

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Safety Warnings
- **HAZARD:** Heavy component. Use approved lifting equipment. Improper handling can cause crushing injury or component damage.
- **HAZARD:** Pinch points at hinge line. Keep hands clear during cowl swing operations.
- **CAUTION:** Acoustic panels are fragile. Avoid impact or point loads.

## Required Tools and Equipment
- Nacelle cowl stand (P/N: AP360-GSE-5401)
- Torque wrench, 0-200 Nm (calibrated within 90 days)
- Socket set, 12-point deep sockets
- Latch tool, special (P/N: AP360-TOOL-5402)
- Safety stands and soft slings
- Torque seal marker

## Required Materials
- Hinge pin lubricant (MIL-PRF-23827)
- Latch grease (AeroShell Grease 22)
- Safety wire, 0.032" diameter (MS20995C32)

## Removal Procedure

### Preparation
1. **Position aircraft** with engines shut down and cooled (< 40°C).
2. **Chock main landing gear** and set parking brake.
3. **Establish ground power** if required for work lighting.
4. **Place cowl stand** adjacent to engine nacelle.

### Disconnect Systems (if required)
5. **Disconnect anti-ice ducting** at forward coupling (if installed on this configuration).
6. **Disconnect electrical bonding jumpers** - mark positions for reinstallation.
7. **Document serial numbers** of all components for traceability.

### Unlatch Fan Cowl
8. **Release upper latches** (4 places) using special latch tool.
9. **Release lower latches** (4 places).
10. **Verify all latches are fully open** - visual confirmation required.

### Open Fan Cowl
11. **Have assistant support cowl** during initial swing to prevent over-travel.
12. **Slowly swing cowl open** to approximately 90 degrees using manual effort.
13. **Install swing-out safety stand** to support cowl in open position.
14. **Inspect hinge pins and bushings** for wear or damage. Any defects require replacement before proceeding.

### Remove Cowl Halves
15. **Remove hinge pins** (2 per cowl half):
    - Remove retaining hardware
    - Drive pins out using soft drift
    - Collect and inspect pins for wear
16. **Position lifting sling** around cowl half with soft protective padding.
17. **Attach to cowl stand lifting fixture** and take up slack.
18. **Have two assistants stabilize cowl** during lift.
19. **Lift cowl clear** of nacelle and lower onto cowl stand.
20. **Repeat steps 15-19** for second cowl half.

## Installation Procedure

### Preparation
21. **Inspect cowl halves** per PROC 54-07-01 before installation.
22. **Clean hinge pin bores** and apply fresh lubricant.
23. **Inspect acoustic panels** for damage - replace if necessary.

### Install Cowl Halves
24. **Position first cowl half** on lifting fixture.
25. **Lift into position** with two assistants stabilizing.
26. **Align hinge pin bores** - may require minor adjustment.
27. **Install hinge pins** and retaining hardware:
    - Apply MIL-PRF-23827 lubricant to pins
    - Insert pins carefully to avoid damage
    - Install and torque retaining nuts: **85 Nm ± 5 Nm**
    - Safety wire per ATA 20 standard practice
28. **Repeat steps 24-27** for second cowl half.

### Close and Latch
29. **Remove swing-out safety stand**.
30. **Slowly swing cowl closed** - verify no interference with engine or systems.
31. **Engage all latches** (8 places total):
    - Upper latches first
    - Lower latches second
    - Verify positive engagement by attempting to lift cowl edge - should not move
32. **Check latch indicators** - all must show "LATCHED" position.

### Reconnect Systems
33. **Reconnect electrical bonding jumpers** at marked positions.
34. **Measure bonding resistance**: Must be < 2.5 milliohms per ATA 20.
35. **Reconnect anti-ice ducting** if applicable and perform leak check.

### Final Inspection
36. **Perform walk-around visual inspection**:
    - All latches secure
    - No gaps in cowl closeout
    - No tools or debris in nacelle
    - All access panels closed
37. **Complete maintenance record** per repair-record.schema.json.
38. **Apply torque seal** to hinge pin retaining hardware.

## Acceptance Criteria
- All hinge pins torqued to specification with safety wire installed
- All latches engaged and indicators showing "LATCHED"
- Bonding resistance < 2.5 milliohms
- No visual damage to acoustic treatment
- Cowl closes with uniform gap (3 mm ± 1 mm)
