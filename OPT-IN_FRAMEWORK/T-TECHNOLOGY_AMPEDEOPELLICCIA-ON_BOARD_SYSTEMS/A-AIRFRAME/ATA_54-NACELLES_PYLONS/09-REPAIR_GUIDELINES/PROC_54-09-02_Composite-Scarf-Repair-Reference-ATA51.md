# PROC 54-09-02: Composite Scarf Repair - Reference ATA 51

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure provides nacelle-specific guidance for composite scarf repairs, referencing the detailed procedures in ATA 51.

## Critical Warning
**WARNING:** Composite repairs require specialized training and certification. Only technicians certified for CFRP repair may perform this work.

## When to Use Scarf Repair
- Impact damage to CFRP fan cowl panels
- Delamination in composite nacelle skins
- Acoustic panel damage
- Damage within SRM scarf repair limits

## Maximum Repairable Damage
Per SRM limits:
- **Fan cowl panels:** Damage < 150 mm diameter
- **Acoustic panels:** Damage < 100 mm diameter
- **Depth:** Through full laminate thickness acceptable

## Reference to ATA 51
The complete scarf repair procedure is detailed in:
- **ATA 51, Section 09-03:** Composite Scarf Repair Procedures
- **ATA 20, Section 02:** Composite handling and safety

## Nacelle-Specific Considerations

### Acoustic Panel Repairs
When repairing acoustic treatment panels:
1. Maintain acoustic cavity integrity
2. Use perforated face sheet if original was perforated
3. Restore honeycomb core to original density
4. Verify acoustic performance after repair (if critical area)

### Fan Cowl Repairs
When repairing fan cowl structure:
1. Maintain aerodynamic surface smoothness
2. Restore LSP mesh continuity (see PROC 54-08-01)
3. Maintain hinge and latch attach points
4. Consider vibration environment in cure schedule

### Core Cowl Repairs  
When repairing core cowl structure (if CFRP):
1. Consider high-temperature environment
2. Use high-temperature resin system
3. Verify fire barrier integrity if in fire zone

## Materials
All materials per DATA 54-09-04:
- CFRP prepreg: Same fiber type and resin as parent structure
- Honeycomb core: Same density and cell size
- Adhesive film: Temperature compatible
- LSP mesh: Copper or aluminum mesh

## Scarf Taper Ratio
- Standard repair: 20:1 scarf ratio minimum
- Acoustic panels: 30:1 recommended (thinner face sheets)
- Load-bearing areas: 15:1 minimum (with engineering approval)

## Cure Requirements
- Vacuum bag cure: Minimum -20 inHg vacuum
- Temperature: Per material specification (typically 250Â°F for 2 hours)
- Pressure: Atmospheric (vacuum bag) or autoclave per Engineering

## Post-Repair Inspection
1. Visual inspection for proper surface finish
2. Tap test for delamination
3. Ultrasonic C-scan for critical areas (per PROC 54-07-02)
4. LSP continuity test (per PROC 54-08-01)

## Documentation
- Complete repair record per `/schemas/repair-record.schema.json`
- Reference parent procedure in ATA 51
- Include cure charts and temperature records
- Include post-repair NDT results

## Quality Requirements
- All repairs require QA inspection and approval
- Critical areas require Engineering review
- Repairs > 100 mm diameter require test coupon concurrent with repair
