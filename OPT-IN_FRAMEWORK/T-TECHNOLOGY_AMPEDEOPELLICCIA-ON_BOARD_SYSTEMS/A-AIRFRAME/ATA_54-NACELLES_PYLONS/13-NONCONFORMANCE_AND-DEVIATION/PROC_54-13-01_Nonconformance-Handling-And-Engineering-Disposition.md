# PROC 54-13-01: Nonconformance Handling and Engineering Disposition

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure defines the process for handling nonconformances and obtaining Engineering Dispositions for nacelle and pylon work.

## Definitions

### Nonconformance (NCR)
Any condition that does not meet design requirements, specifications, or approved procedures, including:
- Damage beyond SRM repair limits
- Material or workmanship defects
- Dimensional out-of-tolerance conditions
- Process deviations
- Unapproved repairs found during inspection

### Engineering Disposition (ED)
Formal engineering evaluation and decision on how to handle a nonconformance:
- **Use-as-is:** Accept without rework (with justification)
- **Rework:** Define specific corrective actions
- **Repair:** Define approved repair method
- **Scrap:** Reject and replace component

## When NCR Required

### Mandatory NCR Situations
1. Any damage to primary structure (pylon, engine mounts)
2. Cracks in any structural component
3. Corrosion exceeding limits
4. Repairs exceeding SRM limits
5. Unapproved previous repairs discovered
6. Material discrepancies
7. Workmanship defects
8. Process deviations

## NCR Process

### Step 1: Identification
When nonconformance identified:
1. **Stop work immediately** in affected area
2. Tag component/area with red "NCR" tag
3. Photograph condition (multiple angles with scale)
4. Quarantine component if removable

### Step 2: Documentation
Complete NCR form (DATA 54-13-02) with:
- NCR number (sequential tracking)
- Date and technician name
- Aircraft MSN and location
- Component part number and serial number
- Detailed description of nonconformance
- Measurements and dimensions
- Photographs attached
- Work order number
- Discovery method (inspection, test, etc.)

### Step 3: Initial Review
QA Inspector reviews NCR:
- Verify accuracy and completeness
- Classify severity (Minor, Major, Critical)
- Determine if flight safety affected
- Route to appropriate authority

### Step 4: Engineering Evaluation
Engineering reviews NCR and:
- Performs analysis (stress, loads, fatigue, etc.)
- Requests additional information if needed
- May request additional testing or inspection
- Determines disposition

### Step 5: Disposition
Engineering provides written disposition:
- **Use-as-is:** Technical justification required
- **Rework:** Specific instructions provided
- **Repair:** Reference approved repair procedure or create new one
- **Scrap:** Authorization to remove and replace

### Step 6: Implementation
Once disposition approved:
- Implement corrective action per Engineering instructions
- QA verification of corrective action
- Update NCR form with actions taken
- Remove red tag when complete

### Step 7: Closure
QA closes NCR when:
- All corrective actions complete
- Verification inspections passed
- Documentation complete
- Root cause identified (if applicable)
- Preventive actions defined (if applicable)

## Engineering Disposition Requirements

### When ED Required (vs. NCR alone)
Engineering Disposition is mandatory for:
- Any nonconformance to primary structure
- Changes to approved data or procedures
- Material substitutions
- Dimensional deviations > drawing tolerance
- Stress-sensitive areas

### ED Package Contents
Engineering must provide:
1. **Analysis:**
   - Stress analysis (if applicable)
   - Fatigue analysis (if applicable)
   - Damage tolerance evaluation (if applicable)
   - Finite Element Analysis results (if complex)

2. **Disposition Decision:**
   - Clear accept/reject decision
   - Technical justification
   - Supporting calculations or test data

3. **Instructions (if rework/repair):**
   - Step-by-step procedure
   - Material specifications
   - Inspection requirements
   - Acceptance criteria

4. **Limitations (if use-as-is):**
   - Operational restrictions (if any)
   - Reduced inspection intervals (if applicable)
   - Life limits (if applicable)

### ED Approval Authority
| Severity | Approval Required From |
|----------|------------------------|
| Minor | Structures Engineering |
| Major | Chief Engineer + QA Manager |
| Critical | Chief Engineer + Airworthiness + FAA (if delegated) |

## Severity Classification

### Minor
- No effect on structural integrity or safety
- Cosmetic or secondary structure only
- Example: Paint defect, minor dent in fairing

### Major
- Affects secondary structure
- May affect performance or longevity
- Requires repair but not immediate grounding
- Example: Corrosion in core cowl, small crack in non-primary structure

### Critical
- Affects primary structure or flight safety
- May require immediate grounding
- Requires urgent Engineering action
- Example: Crack in pylon spar, crack in engine mount fitting

## Traceability and Records

### NCR Records Retention
- Electronic: Permanent archive
- Paper: Minimum 30 years
- Linked to aircraft maintenance records
- Include in Digital Product Passport (ATA 95)

### Trending and Analysis
Quality department must:
- Track NCR statistics (type, frequency, cause)
- Identify recurring issues
- Implement corrective actions
- Report trends to management

## Special Cases

### Unapproved Repairs Found
If unapproved previous repair discovered:
1. Immediately create NCR
2. Engineering must evaluate structural integrity
3. May require re-analysis of entire component
4. Aircraft may be grounded pending evaluation
5. Notify fleet if issue may affect other aircraft

### Emergency Situations
If flight safety affected:
1. Ground aircraft immediately
2. Notify Chief Engineer and Airworthiness
3. Expedited Engineering Disposition process
4. May require conference call with FAA
5. Fleet notification if applicable
