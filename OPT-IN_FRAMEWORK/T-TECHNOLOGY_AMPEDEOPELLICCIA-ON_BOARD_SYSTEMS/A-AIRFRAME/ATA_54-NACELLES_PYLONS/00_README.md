# ATA 54: Nacelles & Pylons

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** This chapter contains the Structural Repair Manual (SRM) data for the nacelles and pylons. These are primary structures that carry engine thrust, aerodynamic, and inertial loads. Incorrect repair or maintenance can lead to engine separation or loss of aircraft control. All procedures are mandatory.

## Scope and Structure
This chapter provides all technical data for the inspection, maintenance, and repair of the AMPEL360 nacelles and engine mounting pylons. This includes:
-   **Nacelle Structure:** Fan cowls, core cowls, and access panels.
-   **Pylons:** The primary structure connecting the engines to the airframe.
-   **Engine Mounts:** Failsafe fittings that attach the engine to the pylon.
-   **Thrust Reversers:** Mechanisms for decelerating the aircraft.
-   **Integrated Systems:** Pass-throughs for fuel, hydraulics, pneumatics, and electrical wiring.

## Governance
-   **Zero Deviation:** All repairs must follow the methodologies defined herein or in the referenced ATA 51. Damage to primary load-path elements (pylon spars, engine mounts) requires a formal Engineering Disposition.
-   **Qualification Basis:** All repairs are substantiated by the damage tolerance philosophy and test plans defined in `/10-QUALIFICATION_AND_TEST_PLANS`.
-   **Traceability:** Every structural repair requires a complete, auditable Repair Record per the schema in `/schemas`.

## BWB Specific Considerations
-   **Integrated Nacelles:** The nacelles are highly integrated with the upper surface of the blended wing body, creating complex aerodynamic and structural interfaces.
-   **Acoustic Treatment:** Nacelle liners contain extensive acoustic treatment to mitigate noise from the open-fan propulsors. Repairs must restore these acoustic properties.
-   **High-Bypass Loads:** The large diameter of the open-fan propulsors imparts significant loads into the pylon and nacelle structure.

## Key Cross-References
-   **ATA 20/51:** Provide foundational workmanship and major repair methodologies.
-   **ATA 53:** Defines the fuselage structure to which the pylons attach.
-   **ATA 71-79:** Define the engine and propulsion systems housed within the nacelles.
