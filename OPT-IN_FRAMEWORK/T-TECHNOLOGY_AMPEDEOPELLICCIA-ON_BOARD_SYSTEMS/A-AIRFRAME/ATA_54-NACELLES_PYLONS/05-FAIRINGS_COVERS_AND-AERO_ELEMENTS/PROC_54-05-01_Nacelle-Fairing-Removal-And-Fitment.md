# PROC 54-05-01: Nacelle Fairing Removal and Fitment

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure covers removal, installation, and adjustment of aerodynamic fairings around the nacelle and pylon interface areas.

## Safety
- **CAUTION:** Fairings are lightweight and can be damaged by improper handling
- **NOTE:** Some fairings contain lightning strike protection mesh - handle with care

## Fairing Types
1. **Pylon-to-Wing Fairings:** Upper and lower fairings covering pylon/wing junction
2. **Pylon-to-Fuselage Fairings:** Aft fairings at pylon/fuselage attachment
3. **Nacelle-to-Pylon Fairings:** Transition fairings between nacelle and pylon

## Removal Procedure
1. Remove fasteners per DATA 54-05-02
2. Support fairing to prevent dropping
3. Carefully withdraw fairing from position
4. Inspect mating surfaces and seals
5. Store fairing in protective cover

## Installation Procedure
1. Inspect fairing for damage before installation
2. Clean mating surfaces
3. Position fairing with proper alignment
4. Install fasteners hand-tight
5. Adjust for proper fit (gaps 2-4 mm uniform)
6. Torque fasteners per DATA 54-05-02
7. Verify smooth aerodynamic contour

## Acceptance Criteria
- Uniform gaps around fairing edges
- No interference with adjacent components
- All fasteners properly torqued
- Smooth contour transitions
