# PROC 54-08-01: LSP Restoration and Continuity Test

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure describes the restoration and testing of Lightning Strike Protection (LSP) systems on nacelle and pylon structures.

## Lightning Strike Protection Overview
Nacelle and pylon structures incorporate LSP through:
- Conductive mesh embedded in CFRP skins
- Aluminum or copper foil strips on leading edges
- Bonding jumpers across removable panels
- Diverter strips at critical junctions

## When LSP Work Required
- After any structural repair to CFRP components
- After panel replacement
- After paint/coating work
- Periodic testing per ATA 05 (every 5,000 FH)

## Required Equipment
- Digital micro-ohmmeter (0.001 ohm resolution)
- Test leads and probes
- Bonding strap kit
- Conductive sealant (per DATA 54-08-02)
- Copper mesh material (for repairs)

## LSP Continuity Test Procedure

### 1. Preparation
- Clean all test points with solvent
- Remove paint or coating at test points if necessary
- Verify micro-ohmmeter calibrated within 1 year

### 2. Bonding Resistance Measurement
Test the following paths:
- Each removable panel to airframe structure
- Across all hinges and latch points
- Nacelle to pylon interface
- Pylon to airframe interface
- Thrust reverser components to nacelle

### 3. Test Method
1. Connect micro-ohmmeter leads to test points
2. Apply firm pressure to ensure good contact
3. Record resistance reading
4. Repeat 3 times and average

### 4. Acceptance Criteria
- **All bonding paths:** < 2.5 milliohms
- **Panel-to-structure:** < 2.5 milliohms
- **Hinge bonding jumpers:** < 5.0 milliohms

## LSP Restoration After Repair

### For Composite Repairs
1. Ensure conductive mesh continuous through repair
2. Overlap mesh minimum 50 mm beyond repair boundary
3. Use conductive adhesive per DATA 54-08-02
4. Bond mesh to existing LSP system
5. Test continuity after cure

### For Panel Replacement
1. Install new bonding jumpers per design
2. Use copper braid, min 6 AWG
3. Crimp terminals with approved tooling
4. Torque attachment hardware per DATA 54-08-02
5. Test continuity

### For Paint/Coating Work
1. Ensure paint does not insulate LSP paths
2. Use conductive primer on CFRP surfaces
3. Verify continuity after painting
4. Remove paint from bonding points if necessary

## Documentation
- Record all resistance measurements
- Document any out-of-tolerance readings
- Photograph bonding strap installations
- Include in repair record per schema

## Corrective Actions
If resistance > 2.5 milliohms:
1. Clean contact surfaces
2. Re-test
3. If still high, inspect bonding strap for:
   - Corrosion
   - Broken strands
   - Poor crimp connection
4. Replace bonding strap if defective
5. Re-test to verify compliance
