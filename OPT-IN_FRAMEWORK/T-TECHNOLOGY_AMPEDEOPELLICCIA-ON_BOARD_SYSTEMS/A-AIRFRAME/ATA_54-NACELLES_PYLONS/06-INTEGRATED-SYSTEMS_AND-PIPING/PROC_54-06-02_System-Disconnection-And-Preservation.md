# PROC 54-06-02: System Disconnection and Preservation

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure describes proper disconnection, capping, and preservation of system lines and hoses when removing nacelle or pylon components.

## General Safety
- **WARNING:** Fuel and hydraulic systems may be pressurized - depressurize before disconnection
- **WARNING:** Bleed air lines may be hot - allow cooling time
- **CAUTION:** Prevent contamination entry into all open lines

## Required Materials
- Protective caps and plugs (appropriate sizes per DATA 54-06-03)
- Preservation tags (red for capped lines)
- Cleaning solvent (approved per ATA 20)
- Thread lubricant (fuel/hydraulic compatible)
- Safety wire

## Depressurization
1. Verify aircraft electrical power OFF
2. Verify hydraulic pumps OFF
3. Verify fuel pumps OFF
4. Relieve system pressure at designated bleed points
5. Verify zero pressure before proceeding

## Fuel Line Disconnection
1. Place drip pans under connection points
2. Loosen fittings slowly to allow fuel drainage
3. Disconnect fitting completely
4. Drain residual fuel into approved container
5. Clean connection threads
6. Install protective caps and plugs immediately
7. Tag connections with preservation tag
8. Dispose of fuel residue per environmental regulations

## Hydraulic Line Disconnection
1. Place absorbent pads under connection points
2. Slowly loosen fittings
3. Disconnect and allow fluid drainage
4. Clean connection threads with approved solvent
5. Install protective caps/plugs immediately
6. Tag connections
7. Dispose of hydraulic fluid per regulations

## Pneumatic/Air Duct Disconnection
1. Verify system cool (< 150Â°F)
2. Remove clamps or fasteners
3. Separate duct sections
4. Inspect duct ends for damage
5. Install protective covers to prevent FOD entry
6. Tag connections

## Electrical Harness Disconnection
1. De-energize all circuits
2. Remove connector backshells or protective covers
3. Disconnect connectors using proper tools
4. Install protective covers on connectors
5. Secure harnesses to prevent damage
6. Tag connectors for reinstallation

## Preservation During Storage
For extended storage (> 30 days):
- Fuel lines: Flush and purge, fill with preservation fluid
- Hydraulic lines: Cap with desiccant plugs
- Air ducts: Seal with moisture barrier caps
- Electrical connectors: Apply corrosion preventive compound

## Reconnection
Reverse disconnection procedure with additional steps:
1. Inspect all sealing surfaces
2. Replace O-rings and seals as required
3. Apply thread lubricant per system requirements
4. Torque all fittings per DATA 54-06-03
5. Safety wire where required
6. Perform leak checks per system ATA chapter
7. Remove all preservation tags

## Leak Check Requirements
- **Fuel:** Pressurize to 50 PSI, check for leaks
- **Hydraulic:** Pressurize to 3000 PSI, check for leaks
- **Pneumatic:** Pressurize to system operating pressure, check for leaks

## Documentation
- Record all disconnections in aircraft log
- Tag all preserved lines with date and technician ID
- Document any anomalies or damage found
- Update maintenance records
