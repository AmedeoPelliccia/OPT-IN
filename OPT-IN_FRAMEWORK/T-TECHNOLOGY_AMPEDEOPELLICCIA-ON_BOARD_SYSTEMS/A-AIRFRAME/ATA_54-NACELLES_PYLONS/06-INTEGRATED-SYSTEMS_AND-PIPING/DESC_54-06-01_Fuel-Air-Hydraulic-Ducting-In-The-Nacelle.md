# DESC 54-06-01: Fuel, Air, and Hydraulic Ducting in the Nacelle

## Overview
The nacelle and pylon structure provide routing and support for multiple systems connecting the airframe to the engine:

## System Routing

### Fuel System (ATA 28/73)
- **Supply Line:** Main fuel feed from wing tank to engine
- **Return Line:** Unused fuel return to tank
- **Drain Lines:** Low point drains
- **Material:** Stainless steel hard lines and flexible hoses
- **Pressure Rating:** 600 PSI working pressure

### Hydraulic System (ATA 29)
- **Supply Lines:** Hydraulic power to thrust reverser actuators
- **Return Lines:** Return flow to reservoir
- **Material:** Titanium tubing, fire-resistant hoses
- **Pressure Rating:** 3000 PSI working pressure

### Pneumatic/Air System (ATA 36/75)
- **Bleed Air Duct:** Engine bleed air to airframe
- **Anti-Ice Air:** Supply to nacelle anti-ice system
- **Cooling Air:** Accessory cooling
- **Material:** Titanium or Inconel ducting
- **Temperature Rating:** Up to 650Â°F

### Electrical System (ATA 24)
- **Power Harnesses:** Engine starting and control power
- **Signal Harnesses:** Engine sensors and FADEC
- **Routing:** Protected conduits with fire barriers
- **Shielding:** EMI shielded per ATA 20 requirements

## Fire Zone Considerations
All lines passing through fire zones (ATA 26) must:
- Be fire-resistant rated for 15 minutes minimum
- Have fire seals at all penetrations
- Include fire detection capability
- Be segregated from non-fire-resistant systems

## Separation Requirements
Per ATA 20 standard practices:
- Fuel lines minimum 6 inches from electrical
- Hydraulic lines minimum 3 inches from electrical
- Clamp spacing per DATA 54-06-03
- Vibration isolation at all hard points

## Maintenance Access
System disconnection required for:
- Engine removal/installation
- Pylon removal
- Major nacelle repairs
- Component replacement
