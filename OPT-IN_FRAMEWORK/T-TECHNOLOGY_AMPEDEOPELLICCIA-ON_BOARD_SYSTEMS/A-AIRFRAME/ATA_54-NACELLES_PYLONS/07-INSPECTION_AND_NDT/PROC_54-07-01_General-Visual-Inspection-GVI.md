# PROC 54-07-01: General Visual Inspection (GVI)

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure defines the General Visual Inspection (GVI) requirements for nacelle and pylon structures.

## Inspection Frequency
Per ATA 05 maintenance program:
- **A-Check:** Quick visual walk-around
- **C-Check:** Detailed GVI with panels removed
- **Special Inspections:** After hard landing, bird strike, or ground damage event

## Required Tools
- Flashlight (minimum 500 lumens)
- Inspection mirror
- Magnifying glass (10x minimum)
- Camera for documentation
- Borescope (for internal areas)

## Inspection Areas

### External Nacelle Structure
Inspect for:
- **Cracks:** Especially at fastener holes, hinge points, latch areas
- **Delamination:** CFRP panels - tap test for bond integrity
- **Dents/Impact Damage:** Document size and location
- **Corrosion:** Aluminum components, especially in joints
- **Erosion:** Leading edges and high-velocity areas
- **Paint/Coating:** Condition of protective coatings

### Pylon Structure
Inspect for:
- **Structural cracks:** At attach fittings, spar webs, rib junctions
- **Corrosion:** Especially at aluminum/titanium interfaces
- **Fastener condition:** Loose, missing, or damaged fasteners
- **Fretting:** At bolted joints (indicated by powder residue)
- **Deformation:** Any permanent set or buckling

### Engine Mount Fittings
Inspect for:
- **Cracks:** Especially in lug bores and radius areas
- **Wear:** Bearing surfaces and bushings
- **Corrosion:** All surfaces, especially hidden areas
- **Deformation:** Elongated holes, bent lugs

### Thrust Reverser
Inspect for:
- **Cascade vane damage:** Bent or broken vanes
- **Blocker door condition:** Hinge wear, seal damage
- **Actuator leaks:** Hydraulic fluid evidence
- **Lock mechanism:** Wear, proper engagement

### Fairings and Covers
Inspect for:
- **Cracks:** In GFRP or CFRP materials
- **Fastener condition:** All fasteners present and secure
- **Fit:** Proper gaps and alignment
- **Seal condition:** Deteriorated or missing seals

## Inspection Technique

### Lighting
- Use oblique lighting to highlight surface irregularities
- Inspect from multiple angles
- Use mirror to view hidden areas

### Cleanliness
- Clean area before inspection
- Remove grease, dirt, or paint as needed to see structure

### Documentation
For any finding:
1. Photograph with scale reference
2. Measure and record dimensions
3. Note exact location (station, zone, part number)
4. Classify per damage classification schema
5. Record in maintenance log

## Acceptance Criteria
- **No cracks** in primary structure
- **No corrosion** beyond minor surface oxidation
- **No dents** > 3 mm deep in primary structure
- **No delamination** in composite panels
- **All fasteners** present and secure
- **No FOD** present

## Disposition of Findings

### Minor Findings
- Surface corrosion: Clean and treat per ATA 20
- Minor scratches: Blend and repaint
- Missing fasteners: Replace per specifications

### Major Findings
- Cracks in primary structure: Refer to Engineering
- Significant corrosion: Perform repair per ATA 51
- Large dents/damage: Classify and repair per SRM

### Critical Findings
- Cracks in engine mount fittings: Replace fitting immediately
- Structural deformation: Engineering Disposition required
- Multiple cracks: Ground aircraft, Engineering involvement
