# PROC 54-07-02: C-Scan and Ultrasonic for Nacelles

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure describes ultrasonic and C-scan inspection methods for CFRP nacelle structures to detect delamination, disbonds, and internal damage.

## When Required
- Suspect impact damage to composite nacelle components
- Pre-repair verification of damage extent
- Post-repair verification
- Scheduled inspections per ATA 05

## Required Equipment
- Ultrasonic flaw detector with A-scan capability
- C-scan automated scanner (for large area inspection)
- Ultrasonic couplant (water-based gel)
- Calibration blocks (CFRP reference standards)
- Data recording system

## Calibration
1. Use CFRP reference block with known defects
2. Set probe frequency: 5 MHz for nacelle panels
3. Adjust gain for proper amplitude
4. Verify detection of reference defects
5. Document calibration settings

## Inspection Procedure

### Manual Ultrasonic (A-Scan)
1. Clean inspection area
2. Apply couplant gel to surface
3. Place probe perpendicular to surface
4. Move probe in overlapping pattern
5. Monitor A-scan display for:
   - Loss of back-wall echo (delamination)
   - Mid-thickness reflections (internal damage)
   - Reduced amplitude (porosity or voids)

### Automated C-Scan
1. Mount component on scan fixture
2. Program scan area and resolution
3. Set scan parameters (gate, threshold)
4. Run automated scan
5. Review C-scan image for:
   - Dark areas indicating delamination
   - Irregular patterns indicating damage
   - Size and depth of defects

## Acceptance Criteria
- **No delaminations** > 25 mm diameter in primary structure
- **No delaminations** at fastener holes (zero tolerance)
- **No disbonds** between face sheets and core
- **Porosity** < 2% by area

## Documentation
- Save all C-scan images
- Record defect locations, sizes, and depths
- Compare to previous inspections (trending)
- Include in repair record per schema
