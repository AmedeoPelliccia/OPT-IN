# PROC 54-07-03: Eddy Current and Dye Penetrant Methods

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effectivity:** All AMPEL360 aircraft

## Purpose
This procedure describes Eddy Current Testing (ECT) and Liquid Penetrant Testing (LPT) for metallic nacelle and pylon components.

## Eddy Current Testing (ECT)

### Applications
- Engine mount fitting lug bores
- Pylon attach fitting holes
- Aluminum structure surface cracks
- Fastener holes in critical areas

### Equipment
- Eddy Current flaw detector
- Surface probe (pencil probe)
- Bolt hole probe (various sizes per DATA 54-07-04)
- Calibration standards (aluminum and titanium)

### Procedure
1. Clean inspection surface (remove paint, corrosion, oil)
2. Calibrate equipment with reference standard
3. Select appropriate probe for application
4. Scan surface or hole in systematic pattern
5. Note any signal anomalies indicating cracks
6. Mark and measure any indications found

### Acceptance Criteria
- **Zero tolerance** for cracks in engine mount fittings
- **Zero tolerance** for cracks in pylon attach fittings
- Surface cracks > 3 mm require engineering evaluation

## Liquid Penetrant Testing (LPT)

### Applications
- Titanium engine mount fittings
- Aluminum pylon fittings
- Steel thrust reverser components
- Areas not accessible to ECT

### Materials
- Cleaner (solvent-based or water-based)
- Penetrant (visible dye or fluorescent)
- Developer (dry powder or non-aqueous)

### Procedure
1. **Pre-clean:** Remove all contamination
2. **Apply Penetrant:** Spray or brush on surface
3. **Dwell Time:** Minimum 15 minutes at 60-120Â°F
4. **Remove Excess:** Wipe or rinse per penetrant type
5. **Apply Developer:** Spray thin, uniform coat
6. **Develop Time:** Minimum 10 minutes
7. **Inspect:** Look for red (or fluorescent) indications
8. **Interpret:** Classify indications (crack, porosity, etc.)
9. **Post-clean:** Remove all penetrant materials

### Acceptance Criteria
- **No linear indications** in primary structure
- **No crack indications** at radius areas or holes
- Round indications < 1.5 mm diameter may be acceptable (evaluate per ATA 51)

## Documentation
For all NDT:
- Record method, date, technician
- Document all indications found
- Photograph indications with scale
- Record acceptance/rejection decision
- Include in inspection record per schema

## Safety
- **LPT:** Use in well-ventilated area, flammable materials
- **ECT:** No special safety requirements
