# DESC 57-01-02: Damage Tolerance Philosophy

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Introduction

The AMPEL360 BWB wing structure is designed and maintained according to a damage tolerance philosophy per FAA Part 25.571. This document defines the damage tolerance approach for wing structural maintenance and repair.

## 2. Damage Tolerance Principles

### 2.1 Design Philosophy

The wing structure is designed to:
- Sustain load with damage present
- Be damage tolerant for the design service life
- Have no single point of failure in primary structure
- Allow detection of damage before it becomes critical

### 2.2 Inspection Strategy

Multi-level inspection approach:
1. **Walkaround Inspections:** Visual checks for obvious damage
2. **Detailed Visual Inspections (DVI):** Close visual with aids
3. **NDT Inspections:** Ultrasonic, eddy current, C-scan as required
4. **Teardown Inspections:** Scheduled component removals

### 2.3 Damage Categories

**Category 1 - Obvious Damage:**
- Detectable by walkaround inspection
- Must be detected before next flight
- Examples: Dents, gouges, delaminations visible to naked eye

**Category 2 - Detectable Damage:**
- Found during scheduled detailed inspections
- Detection within inspection interval is mandatory
- Examples: Small cracks, hidden delaminations, internal corrosion

**Category 3 - Undetected Damage:**
- Not reliably detectable by routine inspections
- Structure must sustain ultimate load with this damage present
- Examples: Manufacturing defects, micro-cracks

## 3. Damage Limits

### 3.1 Primary Structure Limits

**Spar Caps:**
- No damage allowed in highly stressed areas
- Small scratches/dents up to 0.030" depth in low-stress zones (requires engineering review)

**Wing Box Skins:**
- Upper skin: Damage tolerance substantiated by test
- Lower skin: More restrictive due to compression loads
- Refer to `DATA_57-01-03` for specific limits

**Ribs:**
- No cracks in critical load-bearing ribs
- Small dents acceptable per defined limits

### 3.2 Secondary Structure Limits

More lenient damage allowances with appropriate repair procedures defined.

## 4. Inspection Intervals

Inspection intervals are based on:
- Crack growth analysis
- Corrosion progression rates
- Service experience
- Regulatory requirements

See ATA-05 Time Limits for specific interval tables.

## 5. Repair Philosophy

### 5.1 Repair Classification

**Class 1 - Temporary Repairs:**
- For ferry flights only
- Maximum 50 flight hours or 25 flight cycles
- Requires engineering disposition

**Class 2 - Permanent Repairs:**
- Full restoration of structural capability
- Follow approved SRM procedures
- No life limit if properly executed

**Class 3 - Overhaul/Replacement:**
- Damage exceeds repair limits
- Component replacement required

### 5.2 Repair Substantiation

All repairs to primary structure require:
- FEA analysis (if changing load path)
- Test substantiation (coupon or full-scale)
- Fatigue and damage tolerance assessment
- Documentation in repair record

## 6. Fatigue Management

### 6.1 Safe Life vs Damage Tolerance

- **Primary Structure:** Damage tolerance approach
- **Fasteners:** Safe life with replacement intervals
- **Hinges/Bearings:** Safe life with wear limits

### 6.2 Widespread Fatigue Damage (WFD)

Wing structure is evaluated for WFD. Limit of Validity (LOV) is established:
- Design Service Objective (DSO): 60,000 flight cycles
- LOV: 120,000 flight cycles (2x DSO)

## 7. Environmental Considerations

### 7.1 Corrosion

- Regular corrosion inspections per ATA-05
- Corrosion allowance built into design
- Protective coatings must be maintained

### 7.2 Moisture and Composite Structures

- Composite structures susceptible to moisture ingress
- Bonded repairs must follow proper cure cycles
- Moisture content limits defined in ATA-57-17
