## 2. Governance Structure

### 2.1 Authority and Responsibility

**Structures Engineering** is the responsible authority for:
- Wing structural design and modification approval

- Compliance with certification requirements
- Interpretation of regulatory requirements
- Approval of maintenance program changes
- Coordination with regulatory authorities (NAA/FAA/EASA)

**Quality Assurance** is the responsible authority for:
- Verification of procedure compliance
- Calibration program management
- Non-conformance management
- Audit and surveillance activities

### 2.2 Review and Approval Process

All ATA 57 documentation follows this review and approval workflow:

1. **Authoring:** Technical author drafts document
2. **Technical Review:** Subject matter expert review
3. **Cross-Functional Review:** Structures, M&P, Quality review
4. **Airworthiness Review:** Regulatory compliance check
5. **Approval:** Authorized signatory approval
6. **Release:** Document control release to maintenance organization

### 2.3 Change Management

Changes to approved procedures require:
- **Temporary Change (TC):** Authorized by Structures Engineering for single-use or time-limited changes
- **Revision:** Full review cycle for permanent changes
- **Emergency Change:** Authorized by Chief Engineer for AOG situations, with follow-up formal revision

All changes are tracked in the document revision history with change description and effectivity.

## 3. Effectivity Rules

### 3.1 Procedure Effectivity

Each procedure specifies:
- **Applicable MSN Range:** Which aircraft serial numbers
- **Configuration:** Which wing configuration variants
- **Modification State:** Pre-mod or post-mod applicability
- **Effective Date:** When procedure becomes mandatory

### 3.2 Supersession Rules

- Newer revision supersedes older revision on effective date
- Maintenance in progress may be completed using previous revision if documented
- Emergency procedures supersede routine procedures when specified conditions exist

### 3.3 Temporary Revisions

Temporary revisions are valid for:
- **Maximum Duration:** 12 months from issue date
- **Scope Limitation:** Specific aircraft or specific repair
- **Authority:** Requires engineering approval and QA concurrence
- **Conversion:** Must be converted to permanent revision or expire

### 3.4 Service Bulletin Compliance

When Service Bulletins (SB) affect wing structure:
- SB effectivity takes precedence over routine procedures
- Compliance tracking via ATA 05 maintenance program
- Post-SB procedures reference SB number in effectivity statement
