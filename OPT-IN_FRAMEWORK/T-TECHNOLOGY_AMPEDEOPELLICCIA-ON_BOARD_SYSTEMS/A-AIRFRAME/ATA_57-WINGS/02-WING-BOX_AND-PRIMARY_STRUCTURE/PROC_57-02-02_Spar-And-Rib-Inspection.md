- Camera for documentation
- Mirror inspection tool
- Cleaning solvent (Stoddard or MEK)
- Lint-free wipes

## 5. Safety Precautions
- [ ] Lockout/Tagout (LOTO) for any hydraulic or electrical systems
- [ ] Fuel tank entry procedures if accessing internal wing box (ATA 28)
- [ ] Fall protection if working on wing upper surface
- [ ] Proper ventilation if using solvents
- [ ] Fire extinguisher nearby if fuel vapors possible

## 6. Procedure

### 6.1 Preparation
1. Review aircraft maintenance records for previous findings in wing box area
2. Verify inspection equipment calibration current (within certification date)
3. Perform eddy current system verification using calibration standard
4. Gain access per AMM 57-02-00 (remove required panels)
5. Clean inspection areas with approved solvent and lint-free wipes

### 6.2 Visual Inspection (GVI/DET)

#### 6.2.1 Spar Caps
Inspect for:
- [ ] Cracks at radii and transitions
- [ ] Corrosion (pitting, exfoliation, intergranular)
- [ ] Dents, gouges, or impact damage
- [ ] Paint or coating damage
- [ ] Fluid stains indicating seal leakage

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No cracks visible
- Corrosion within limits per DATA_57-01-03
- No dents > 0.030 inch deep
- No sharp edge gouges

#### 6.2.2 Spar Webs
Inspect for:
- [ ] Cracks at lightening holes and attachments
- [ ] Buckling or wrinkles
- [ ] Corrosion at lap joints
- [ ] Fastener condition (looseness, missing, damaged heads)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No cracks visible
- No buckles or wrinkles indicating overload
- Corrosion within limits per DATA_57-01-03
- All fasteners present and secure

#### 6.2.3 Ribs
Inspect for:
- [ ] Cracks at flange holes and cutouts
- [ ] Corrosion at splices and joints
- [ ] Distortion or permanent set
- [ ] Fastener condition

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No cracks visible at critical areas (attachment holes)
- Corrosion within limits
- No permanent distortion exceeding 0.050 inch from design contour

### 6.3 Eddy Current Inspection (SDI)

#### 6.3.1 Equipment Setup
1. Select appropriate probe frequency:
   - Surface crack detection: 100-400 kHz
   - Subsurface detection: 10-50 kHz
2. Verify lift-off compensation
3. Verify phase angle settings per equipment manual
4. Perform system calibration per MIL-STD-1537

#### 6.3.2 Spar Cap Inspection Zones
Inspect the following areas on front and rear spar caps:
- Wing root attachment (Station 0 to Station 40)
- Pylon attach fittings (if applicable)
- Landing gear attach (if wing-mounted)
- Mid-span high-stress zones
- Wing fold area (if applicable)

**Scan Pattern:**
- 100% coverage of cap flanges
- Overlap adjacent scans by minimum 10%
- Scan rate not to exceed 2 inches/second
- Mark any indications for evaluation

#### 6.3.3 Fastener Hole Inspection
For SSI fastener holes:
- Use rotating bolt hole probe
- Insert probe fully into hole
- Rotate 360Â° while observing display
- Record any indications

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No indications exceeding reference standard (0.010 inch EDM notch)
- Questionable indications require Level III evaluation

### 6.4 Documentation

For all inspections, record:
- [ ] Date and aircraft MSN
- [ ] Inspector name and certification level
- [ ] Inspection zones covered
- [ ] Equipment used and calibration status
- [ ] Findings (location, size, type)
- [ ] Photos of any discrepancies
- [ ] Disposition (acceptable, monitor, repair required)

### 6.5 Disposition of Findings

**Allowable (No Action Required):**
- Surface scratches < 0.010 inch deep
- Small dents meeting DATA_57-01-03 limits
- Corrosion within allowable limits

**Monitor (Re-inspect at Reduced Interval):**
- Indications near but not exceeding limits
- Corrosion at maximum allowable limit
- Reduced interval: 50% of normal interval

**Repair Required:**
- Cracks of any length at critical locations (spar caps, attach fittings)
- Damage exceeding SRM limits
- Corrosion exceeding allowable limits

**Engineering Disposition Required:**
- Unusual findings not covered by SRM
- Multiple cracks or widespread damage
- Findings in SSI locations

## 7. Completion

1. Reinstall access panels per AMM
2. Perform operational checks if any disconnections were made
3. Complete inspection record in maintenance log
4. Update DPP (ATA 95) with inspection results
5. If findings require repair, open work order and reference PROC_57-13-* as applicable

## 8. Inspection Interval

**Baseline Intervals:**
- Visual Inspection (DET): Every C-check (5,000 FH)
- Eddy Current (SDI) at SSI locations: Per SSI schedule (typically 12,000-15,000 FH)

Intervals may be adjusted based on service experience or regulatory directive.

## 9. Quality Control

- [ ] Inspector signature and stamp in aircraft log
- [ ] QA spot check required for SDI inspections (10% sample minimum)
- [ ] Eddy current data archived with aircraft records
