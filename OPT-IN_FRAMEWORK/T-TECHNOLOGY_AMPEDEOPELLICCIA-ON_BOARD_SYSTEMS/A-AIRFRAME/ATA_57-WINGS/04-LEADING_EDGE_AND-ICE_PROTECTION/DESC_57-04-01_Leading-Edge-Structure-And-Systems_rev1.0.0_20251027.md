# DESC 57-04-01: Leading Edge Structure and Systems

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-27

## 1. Introduction
The leading edge provides aerodynamic shape and houses ice protection systems.

## 2. Components
- Fixed leading edge structure (CFRP)
- Movable slats with track assemblies
- Ice protection (electrothermal or pneumatic boots)
- Anti-ice system integration (ref ATA-30)

## 3. Structural Design
- Impact-resistant leading edge design for bird strike
- Attachment to front spar
- Access panels for inspection

## 4. References
- ATA 30: Ice & Rain Protection
