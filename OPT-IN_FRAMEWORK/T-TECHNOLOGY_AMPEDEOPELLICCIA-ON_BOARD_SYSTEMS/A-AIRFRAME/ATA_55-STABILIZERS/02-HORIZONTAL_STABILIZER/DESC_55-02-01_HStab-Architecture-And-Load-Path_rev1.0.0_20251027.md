# ATA 55-02-01: Horizontal Stabilizer Architecture and Load Path

## Overview
This document describes the structural architecture and load path of the AMPEL360 BWB horizontal stabilizer, including spar configuration, rib spacing, skin panel design, and primary load transfer mechanisms.

## Structural Configuration
- **Spar Type:** Two-spar configuration (front spar, rear spar)
- **Material:** CFRP with metallic fittings at attachment points
- **Span:** [TBD] meters
- **Aspect Ratio:** [TBD]

## Load Path Description
1. Aerodynamic loads on skin panels
2. Transfer through ribs to spars
3. Spar bending and shear resistance
4. Load transfer to fuselage attachment fittings
5. Distribution into fuselage primary structure

## Design Load Cases
- Symmetric pull-up maneuver: +3.75g limit load
- Symmetric push-over maneuver: -1.5g limit load
- Asymmetric rolling maneuver
- Gust loads per FAA Part 25.341
- Ground handling loads

Refer to DATA_55-02-04 for complete strength and limit case data.
