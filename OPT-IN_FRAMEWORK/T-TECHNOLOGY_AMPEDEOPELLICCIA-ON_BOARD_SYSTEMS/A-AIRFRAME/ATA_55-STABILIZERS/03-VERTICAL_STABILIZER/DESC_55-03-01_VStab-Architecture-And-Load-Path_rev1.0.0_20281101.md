# ATA 55-03-01: Vertical Stabilizer Architecture and Load Path

## Overview
Describes the structural architecture and load path of the AMPEL360 BWB vertical stabilizer for directional stability and yaw control.

## Structural Configuration
- **Spar Type:** Single-spar configuration with vertical orientation
- **Material:** CFRP with titanium fittings at root attachment
- **Height:** [TBD] meters from waterline

## Load Path
1. Aerodynamic side loads on skin panels
2. Transfer through ribs to main spar
3. Spar bending and torsion resistance
4. Load transfer to fuselage dorsal structure
5. Distribution into fuselage frames and longerons
