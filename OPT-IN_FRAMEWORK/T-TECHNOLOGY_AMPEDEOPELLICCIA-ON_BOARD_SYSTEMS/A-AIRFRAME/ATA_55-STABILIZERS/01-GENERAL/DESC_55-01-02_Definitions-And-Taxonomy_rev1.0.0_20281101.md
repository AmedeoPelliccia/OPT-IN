## Purpose

This document provides standardized definitions and taxonomy for all terms, components, and concepts used throughout ATA 55 Stabilizers documentation.

## Stabilizer Components - Primary Structure

### Horizontal Stabilizer (H-Stab)
The horizontal surface providing pitch stability and trim capability, mounted at the aft section of the AMPEL360 BWB fuselage.

### Vertical Stabilizer (V-Stab)
The vertical surface providing directional stability and yaw control, mounted on top of the aft fuselage.

### Spar
Primary structural member running spanwise through the stabilizer, carrying bending and shear loads. Typically constructed from:
- **Metallic:** Aluminum 7075-T6 or Titanium for high-stress areas
- **Composite:** Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) with unidirectional and fabric plies

### Rib
Structural member running chordwise, maintaining airfoil shape and transferring loads to the spar.

### Skin Panel
Outer aerodynamic surface of the stabilizer, providing aerodynamic shape and contributing to structural strength.

## Control Surfaces

### Elevator
Movable control surface at the trailing edge of the horizontal stabilizer, providing pitch control (nose up/down).

### Rudder
Movable control surface at the trailing edge of the vertical stabilizer, providing yaw control (nose left/right).

### Trim Tab
Small auxiliary control surface mounted on the trailing edge of a primary control surface (elevator or rudder), used to:
- Reduce control force requirements
- Maintain desired flight attitude without continuous pilot input
- Compensate for aerodynamic imbalances

### Balance Tab
Control surface tab that moves opposite to the main control surface to reduce control forces through aerodynamic balancing.

## Attachment and Interface Components

### Hinge
Mechanical device allowing rotational movement of control surfaces, consisting of:
- **Hinge Bracket:** Fixed to stabilizer structure
- **Hinge Pin:** Removable pin providing rotation axis
- **Hinge Bearing:** Low-friction bearing surface (may be bushings or ball bearings)

### Bearing
Load-bearing component providing low-friction rotation or sliding motion. Types include:
- **Ball Bearing:** Spherical elements between races
- **Roller Bearing:** Cylindrical rolling elements
- **Spherical Bearing:** Self-aligning bearing for angular misalignment
- **Plain Bearing (Bushing):** Sliding contact bearing with lubrication

### Attachment Fitting
Structural fitting connecting stabilizer to fuselage, designed to transfer:
- **Bending Moment:** Primary load from stabilizer aerodynamic forces
- **Shear Load:** Vertical and lateral forces
- **Torsional Load:** Twisting moment about the longitudinal axis

## Actuation and Control

### Actuator
Powered device that moves control surfaces. Types include:
- **Hydraulic Actuator:** Uses hydraulic pressure to extend/retract
- **Electro-Hydraulic Actuator (EHA):** Self-contained hydraulic actuator with electric pump
- **Electric Actuator:** Direct electric motor drive
- **Trim Actuator:** Slow-moving actuator for trim adjustment

### Control Horn
Lever arm attached to control surface, providing mechanical advantage for actuator or cable attachment.

### Control Cable
Steel cable transmitting control forces from cockpit or flight control computer to control surfaces.

### Rod End Bearing
Threaded bearing fitting at the end of a control rod or actuator, allowing angular articulation.

## Damage and Defect Terminology

### Delamination
Separation of composite plies within a laminate, typically caused by impact, moisture ingress, or manufacturing defects.

### Void
Air pocket or absence of resin within a composite laminate, reducing structural strength.

### Disbond
Separation of bonded components (e.g., skin from stringer, doubler from skin).

### Corrosion
Chemical or electrochemical degradation of metallic components. Types include:
- **Surface Corrosion:** Limited to outer surface
- **Pitting Corrosion:** Localized deep pits
- **Intergranular Corrosion:** Along grain boundaries
- **Exfoliation Corrosion:** Lifting and flaking of metal layers

### Fatigue Crack
Crack propagating under cyclic loading, typically originating at stress concentrations.

### Foreign Object Damage (FOD)
Damage caused by impact with foreign objects (e.g., tools, debris, hail, bird strike).

### Lightning Strike Damage
Damage to structure or LSP system caused by lightning attachment.

## Inspection Terminology

### General Visual Inspection (GVI)
Visual examination without disassembly or use of special equipment.

### Detailed Visual Inspection (DVI)
Intensive visual examination requiring adequate lighting, mirrors, or borescopes.

### Special Detailed Inspection (SDI)
Intensive examination requiring disassembly, special equipment, or NDT methods.

### Non-Destructive Testing (NDT)
Inspection methods that do not damage or alter the component:
- **Ultrasonic (UT):** High-frequency sound waves to detect internal defects
- **C-Scan:** Ultrasonic method producing plan-view image of internal structure
- **Eddy Current (EC):** Electromagnetic method for detecting surface and near-surface cracks
- **Dye Penetrant (PT):** Liquid penetrant method for surface-breaking cracks
- **Magnetic Particle (MT):** Ferromagnetic particle method for detecting surface and near-surface cracks
- **Radiographic (RT):** X-ray or gamma-ray imaging of internal structure

## Repair Terminology

### Scarf Repair
Composite repair where damaged material is removed at a shallow angle (scarf ratio) and replaced with new laminate.

### External Patch
Repair using additional material bonded to the exterior surface of damaged structure.

### Bolted Repair
Metallic repair using fasteners to attach doubler or splice plate.

### Bonded Repair
Repair using adhesive bonding without mechanical fasteners.

### Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
Computational method for analyzing structural behavior under load, required for repairs affecting primary load path.

## Load and Stress Terminology

### Limit Load
Maximum load expected in service, design must support without permanent deformation.

### Ultimate Load
Limit load multiplied by factor of safety (typically 1.5), design must support without failure.

### Yield Strength
Stress level at which permanent deformation begins.

### Ultimate Strength
Maximum stress before material failure.

### Fatigue Life
Number of load cycles before fatigue crack initiation or propagation to critical size.

## Measurement and Position Terminology

### Fuselage Station (FS)
Longitudinal distance from aircraft datum (typically nose), measured in inches or millimeters.

### Buttock Line (BL)
Lateral distance from aircraft centerline, measured in inches or millimeters.

### Water Line (WL)
Vertical distance from aircraft horizontal datum, measured in inches or millimeters.

### Spanwise Location
Position along the span from root (0%) to tip (100%).

### Chordwise Location
Position along the chord from leading edge (0%) to trailing edge (100%).
