# Repair: 52-R1-01 - Seal Seat Touch-Up
**Revision:** 1.0.0
**Effective Date:** 2028-09-25

## 1. Scope
This repair procedure covers minor touch-up of door seal seating surfaces for superficial damage that does not affect structural integrity.

## 2. Applicability
**Minor Repairs Only:** This procedure applies to:
- Surface scratches ≤ 0.5 mm deep
- Small dents ≤ 3 mm diameter, ≤ 1 mm deep
- Minor corrosion (surface only, no pitting)
- Paint chips and wear on seal contact area

**Not Applicable For:**
- Cracks of any size → Requires engineering disposition
- Dents > 3 mm diameter or > 1 mm deep → SRM repair required
- Corrosion with pitting → SRM repair required
- Structural damage → Engineering evaluation required

## 3. Prerequisites
- Door removed or accessible for work
- Cabin ΔP = 0 kPa
- Work area clean and well-lit
- Damage assessed and within repair limits

## 4. Materials Required
| Item | Part Number | Specification |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Aluminum Polish | MIL-P-6888 | Type II, Grade A |
| Cleaning Solvent | MIL-PRF-680 | Type II |
| Lint-free Cloths | — | Clean, non-abrasive |
| Touch-up Paint | Per aircraft paint spec | Match existing color |
| Sealing Compound | — | Per AMM (if required) |

## 5. Tools Required
- Fine abrasive paper (320, 400, 600 grit)
- Depth gauge (0.01 mm resolution)
- Inspection mirror
- Flashlight
- Cleaning brushes (soft bristle)

## 6. Procedure

### 6.1 Damage Assessment
1. Clean area thoroughly with approved solvent
2. Measure depth of damage with depth gauge
3. Verify damage is within repair limits:
   - Scratches: ≤ 0.5 mm deep
   - Dents: ≤ 3 mm diameter AND ≤ 1 mm deep
   - No cracks present
4. If damage exceeds limits, STOP and refer to engineering

### 6.2 Surface Preparation
1. Clean damaged area with solvent, allow to dry
2. For scratches:
   - Use 320 grit paper to smooth edges
   - Progress to 400 then 600 grit for final finish
   - Blend repair into surrounding area (minimum 25 mm radius)
3. For dents:
   - If raised edges, carefully dress down with 320 grit
   - Do not remove more than 0.2 mm of material
   - Blend edges into surrounding area
4. For corrosion:
   - Remove all traces with 320 grit paper
   - Verify no pitting remains
   - Clean thoroughly

### 6.3 Finishing
1. Polish repaired area with aluminum polish
2. Clean with solvent, inspect under bright light
3. Verify smooth transition to surrounding area
4. Verify no sharp edges that could damage seal

### 6.4 Paint Touch-Up (if required)
1. Apply primer per paint specification
2. Allow proper cure time (per spec)
3. Apply topcoat in thin layers
4. Allow final cure before seal installation

### 6.5 Final Inspection
1. Verify repair area smooth to touch
2. No roughness that could damage seal
3. No residual corrosion
4. Paint coverage adequate (if painted)
5. Dimensional check: verify less than 0.2 mm material removed

## 7. Seal Reinstallation
After repair is complete:
1. Inspect seal for damage
2. Clean seal contact area
3. Install seal per AMM procedure
4. Perform leak test per PROC_52-60-01

## 8. Quality Acceptance Criteria
- Repair area smooth and blended
- No sharp edges or rough spots
- No visible corrosion
- Paint coverage complete and smooth
- Seal seats properly with no gaps
- Leak test passes (≤ 500 sccm/m)

## 9. Documentation
Record in aircraft log:
- Location of repair
- Type and extent of damage
- Repair actions taken
- Materials used
- Leak test results
- Technician and inspector signatures

## 10. Limitations
- Maximum 3 repairs per seal seat area
- Maximum cumulative material removal: 0.5 mm
- If limits exceeded, engineering evaluation required
- Any crack indication requires immediate engineering referral

## 11. Safety Notes
⚠️ **Ensure adequate ventilation when using solvents and paints**
⚠️ **Wear appropriate PPE: safety glasses, gloves, respirator as required**
⚠️ **Dispose of materials per environmental regulations**
