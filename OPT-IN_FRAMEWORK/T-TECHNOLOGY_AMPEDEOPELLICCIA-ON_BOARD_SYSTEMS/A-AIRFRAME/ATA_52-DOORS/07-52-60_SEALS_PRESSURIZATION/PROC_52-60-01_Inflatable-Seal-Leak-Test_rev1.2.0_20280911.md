# Procedure: 52-60-01 - Inflatable Seal Leak Test
**Revision:** 1.2.0

## 1. Prerequisites
- Door closed and locked. Cabin ΔP = 0 kPa.
- **Instrument:** Calibrated mass-flow ultrasonic leak sensor (ULS), range 0–2,000 sccm, accuracy ±1% of reading.

## 2. Procedure
1.  Connect regulated pressure source to the seal inflation test port.
2.  Slowly pressurize seal to the test setpoint of **7.0 kPa ±0.2 kPa**.
3.  Allow pressure to stabilize for **60 seconds**.
4.  Begin measurement. Average the leak rate reading over a **120-second period**.
5.  Record the average leak rate, ambient temperature, and ambient pressure.
6.  Calculate the leak rate per meter of door perimeter.

## 3. Pass/Fail Criteria
- **PASS:** Leak rate is **≤ 500 sccm/m**.
- **FAIL:** Leak rate is > 500 sccm/m. Abort test, depressurize, and investigate for leaks.
