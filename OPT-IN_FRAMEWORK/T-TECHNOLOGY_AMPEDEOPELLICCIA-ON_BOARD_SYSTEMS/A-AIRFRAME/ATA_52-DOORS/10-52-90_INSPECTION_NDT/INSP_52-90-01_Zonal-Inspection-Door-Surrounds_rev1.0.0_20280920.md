# Inspection: 52-90-01 - Zonal Inspection - Door Surrounds
**Revision:** 1.0.0
**Effective Date:** 2028-09-20

## 1. Scope
This inspection procedure covers zonal inspection of door surrounding structure for cracks, corrosion, and damage.

## 2. Inspection Interval
- Initial: At aircraft delivery
- Recurring: Every 3,000 flight hours or 18 months, whichever occurs first
- Special: After any hard landing, severe turbulence, or ground damage event

## 3. Prerequisites
- Aircraft in maintenance hangar with adequate lighting
- Access panels removed per AMM
- Surface cleaned and prepared for inspection

## 4. Special Equipment Required
- High-intensity LED inspection light (minimum 1,000 lumens)
- Magnifying glass (10x)
- Eddy current NDT equipment (for critical areas)
- Borescope (as required for hidden areas)
- Inspection mirror

## 5. Inspection Areas

### 5.1 Door Frame Structure
**Inspection Method:** Visual + Eddy Current (EC)

Critical zones:
- Upper and lower hinge attach points
- Latch receptacle mounting
- Frame corners (stress concentration areas)
- Seal contact surfaces

**Accept/Reject Criteria:**
- ACCEPT: No cracks, scratches < 0.5 mm deep, no corrosion
- REJECT: Any crack, dent > 3 mm deep, active corrosion

### 5.2 Door Threshold
**Inspection Method:** Visual + Dimensional Check

Areas to inspect:
- Wear patterns on threshold surface
- Seal groove condition
- Drainage holes clear and unobstructed
- Attachment hardware secure

**Accept/Reject Criteria:**
- ACCEPT: Wear < 1 mm, no damage to seal groove, drainage holes clear
- REJECT: Wear > 1 mm, damage to seal groove, blocked drainage

### 5.3 Surrounding Skin Panels
**Inspection Method:** Visual

Inspect for:
- Rivet head condition
- Skin cracks or wrinkles
- Paint condition
- Lightning strike damage
- Impact damage

**Accept/Reject Criteria:**
- ACCEPT: Rivets flush and secure, no cracks, paint intact
- REJECT: Loose rivets, any cracks, impact damage > 10 mm diameter

### 5.4 Pressure Bulkhead Connection (if applicable)
**Inspection Method:** Visual + Ultrasonic Testing (UT)

Critical area requiring detailed inspection:
- Bulkhead-to-frame joints
- Seal integrity
- Fastener torque and condition

**Accept/Reject Criteria:**
- ACCEPT: No indications on UT, fasteners torqued correctly, seal intact
- REJECT: Any UT indication, loose fasteners, damaged seal

## 6. Documentation
For each inspection:
1. Record date, flight hours, and flight cycles
2. Document findings with photographs
3. Mark inspected areas with inspection stamp
4. Enter findings in aircraft log
5. For any rejectable findings, generate discrepancy report

## 7. Corrective Actions
- Minor: Surface treatment, paint touch-up, fastener replacement
- Major: Structural repair per SRM, engineering disposition required

## 8. Sign-Off Requirements
- Inspector Level II (minimum) for visual inspection
- NDT Level II (minimum) for eddy current and UT
- Engineering approval required for any repair
