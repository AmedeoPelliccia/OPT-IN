# PROC_27-13-01: Nonconformance Handling and Engineering Disposition

**Document ID:** PROC_27-13-01_Nonconformance-Handling-And-Engineering-Disposition_rev1.0.0_20251030  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-30

## Purpose

Defines process for handling nonconformances (NCR) in flight control system components.

## NCR Process

### Step 1: Identification

Any condition that deviates from specifications, drawings, or procedures must be documented as an NCR.

### Step 2: Documentation

1. Complete NCR form (DATA_27-13-02).
2. Include:
   - Part number and serial number
   - Description of nonconformance
   - Photographs (if applicable)
   - Measurements and inspection data

### Step 3: Segregation

Tag nonconforming part as "HOLD - NCR in Process" and segregate from serviceable parts.

### Step 4: Engineering Disposition

Engineering reviews NCR and provides one of the following dispositions:

**Accept As-Is:** Part meets functional requirements despite deviation  
**Rework:** Part can be reworked to meet specification  
**Repair:** Approved repair procedure exists  
**Scrap:** Part cannot be made conforming  
**Use As-Is (UAI):** Part can be used with specific limitations

### Step 5: Implementation

- If rework/repair: Perform per approved procedure
- If UAI: Document limitations in aircraft records
- If scrap: Destroy part to prevent inadvertent use

### Step 6: Closure

- Verify corrective action
- Close NCR with engineering approval
- Update aircraft/component records

## Approval Authority

**Flight Safety Critical Items:**
- Engineering disposition: Flight Controls Engineering
- Quality approval: QA Manager
- Final approval: Airworthiness Engineering

**Non-Critical Items:**
- Engineering disposition: Responsible Engineer
- Quality approval: QA Inspector
