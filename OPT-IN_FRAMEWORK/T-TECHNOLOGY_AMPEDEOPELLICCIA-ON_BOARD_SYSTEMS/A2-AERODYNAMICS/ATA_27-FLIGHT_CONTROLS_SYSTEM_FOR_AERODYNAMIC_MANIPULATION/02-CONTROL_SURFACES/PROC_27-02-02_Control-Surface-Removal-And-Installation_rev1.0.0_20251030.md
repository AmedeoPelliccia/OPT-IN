# PROC_27-02-02: Control Surface Removal and Installation

**Document ID:** PROC_27-02-02_Control-Surface-Removal-And-Installation_rev1.0.0_20251030  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Task Duration:** 4-8 hours (depending on surface type)  
**Personnel:** 2 technicians (Level 2 or higher)  
**Safety Critical:** YES

## Scope

This procedure covers the removal and installation of primary and secondary control surfaces for the AMPEL360 BWB aircraft.

## Safety Warnings

**⚠️ FLIGHT SAFETY CRITICAL:** Improper installation can result in control surface detachment or binding, leading to loss of control.

**⚠️ WEIGHT AND BALANCE:** Control surfaces are mass-balanced. Any replacement must use surfaces with equivalent balance characteristics or require rebalancing.

**⚠️ RIGGING:** Control surface rigging must be verified post-installation. Improper rigging can cause control reversal or restricted authority.

## Required Tools and Equipment

- Aircraft hoist or jacks (if required for access)
- Control surface support stand
- Torque wrenches (calibrated): 10-500 N·m range
- Digital angle finder (±0.1° accuracy)
- Freeplay measurement fixture
- Balance rig (for balance verification)
- Safety wire and tools
- Sealant and primer (per ATA-20 specifications)

## Consumables

- AN960 washers (as required)
- MS21042 locknuts (as required)
- Safety wire (MS20995C)
- Sealant: PR-1422 (fuel tank sealant) or equivalent
- Primer: Alodine 1200S or equivalent
- Torque stripe paint

## Pre-Removal Steps

1. **Power Down:** Ensure all hydraulic and electrical power to actuators is OFF and tagged out.
2. **Control Lock:** Install control locks to prevent inadvertent actuator movement.
3. **Weight and Balance:** Record current aircraft weight and balance configuration.
4. **Documentation:** Photograph control surface position and rigging before removal.
5. **Cleanliness:** Clean work area to prevent FOD entry into control system.

## Removal Procedure

### Step 1: Disconnect Actuator

1. Support control surface with stand to prevent binding or overload on hinges.
2. Disconnect actuator from control surface attachment lug:
   - Remove safety wire from attachment bolt.
   - Loosen and remove attachment bolt and washers.
   - **Torque Reference:** Reinstallation torque = 150 N·m ± 10 N·m (for typical aileron).
3. Cap actuator rod end to prevent contamination.

### Step 2: Remove Hinge Pins

1. Remove hinge pin safety devices (split pins, safety wire, or lock rings).
2. Using a hinge pin drift and soft mallet, gently drive out hinge pins:
   - Start from outboard and work inboard.
   - **Caution:** Do not damage hinge lugs or bushings.
3. Collect and inspect all pins, bushings, and shims. Discard if wear exceeds limits.

### Step 3: Lower Control Surface

1. With two technicians, carefully lower control surface onto support stand.
2. Inspect hinge fittings on both surface and fixed structure for:
   - Cracks
   - Corrosion
   - Wear (bushing ID, pin OD)
   - Fretting

### Step 4: Inspect and Tag

1. Inspect removed surface for damage.
2. Attach removal tag with date, reason, and flight hours/cycles.
3. Store in clean, dry location if reuse is intended.

## Installation Procedure

### Step 1: Pre-Installation Inspection

1. Verify replacement surface part number and serial number match aircraft configuration.
2. Verify mass balance is within limits (refer to DATA_27-02-04).
3. Inspect hinge fittings for cleanliness and absence of damage.

### Step 2: Position Control Surface

1. With two technicians, carefully position control surface onto hinge fittings.
2. Align hinge lugs and verify clearances.

### Step 3: Install Hinge Pins

1. Apply primer to bushings if new bushings installed.
2. Install hinge pins with proper shims to achieve specified clearances:
   - **Radial clearance:** 0.05-0.15 mm
3. Install hinge pin safety devices (split pins, safety wire, or lock rings).
4. Verify hinge pins are fully seated and secured.

### Step 4: Connect Actuator

1. Remove cap from actuator rod end.
2. Align actuator with control surface attachment lug.
3. Install attachment bolt with washers.
4. Torque to specification: **150 N·m ± 10 N·m** (verify actual value from DATA_27-02-04 for specific surface).
5. Apply torque stripe paint across bolt head and structure.
6. Install safety wire per ATA-20 standard practices.

### Step 5: Rigging and Functional Check

1. Remove control locks.
2. Power up actuators per PROC_27-03-02.
3. Perform rigging check per PROC_27-02-03:
   - Verify neutral position.
   - Verify full travel (up and down limits).
   - Measure freeplay (must be ≤ 0.5°).
4. Perform balance check if mass balance was disturbed.

## Post-Installation Checks

1. **Operational Test:** Cycle control surface through full range 3 times. Listen for binding or unusual noise.
2. **Leak Check:** If fuel tanks are adjacent, perform leak check per ATA-28 procedures.
3. **Documentation:** Update aircraft logbook and component records.
4. **Weight and Balance:** Update weight and balance if surface mass differs from original.
