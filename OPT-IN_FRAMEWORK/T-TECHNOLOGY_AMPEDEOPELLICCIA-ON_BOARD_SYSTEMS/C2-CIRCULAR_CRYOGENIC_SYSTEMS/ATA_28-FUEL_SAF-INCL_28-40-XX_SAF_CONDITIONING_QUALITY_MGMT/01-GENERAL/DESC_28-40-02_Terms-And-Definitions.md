Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Cryogenic Systems Engineering

## Purpose

Provides standardized terminology and definitions for ATA 28-40-XX documentation to ensure consistent understanding across all stakeholders.

## Cryogenic System Terms

**Cryogenic Temperature:** Temperature below -150°C (-238°F), typically referring to liquid hydrogen storage at approximately -253°C (-423°F).

**Boil-off:** Vaporization of cryogenic liquid due to heat leak into the storage system. Measured as mass or volume loss per unit time.

**Heat Leak:** Thermal energy transfer into a cryogenic system, causing boil-off and pressure rise. Measured in watts (W).

**Vacuum Jacket:** Double-wall insulation system with evacuated space between inner and outer walls to minimize conductive and convective heat transfer.

**Multi-Layer Insulation (MLI):** High-performance thermal insulation consisting of multiple layers of reflective material separated by low-conductivity spacers.

**Hold Time:** Duration a cryogenic system can maintain liquid without venting, given a specific heat leak rate and storage pressure limit.

## Fuel System Terms

**SAF (Sustainable Aviation Fuel):** Drop-in replacement fuels meeting ASTM D7566 specifications, derived from sustainable feedstocks.

**Conditioning:** Process of preparing and maintaining fuel quality to meet specifications (temperature control, filtration, additive management).

**CoC (Certificate of Conformance):** Document certifying that materials or components meet specified requirements and standards.

**DPP (Digital Product Passport):** Digital record containing complete lifecycle information for a component (manufacturing, testing, maintenance, modifications).

## Testing and Quality Terms

**Helium Leak Test:** Highly sensitive leak detection method using helium tracer gas and mass spectrometer, typically achieving detection limits of 1×10⁻⁶ mbar·L/s or better.

**Hydrostatic Test (Hydrotest):** Pressure test using liquid (typically water) to verify structural integrity, usually performed at 1.5× design pressure.

**NDT (Non-Destructive Testing):** Inspection methods that do not damage the component (ultrasonic, radiography, dye penetrant, magnetic particle).

**Acceptance Criteria:** Quantitative pass/fail limits for tests and inspections.

**Leak Rate:** Measured quantity of gas passing through a leak, typically expressed in mbar·L/s (millibars × liters per second) or std cc/s (standard cubic centimeters per second).

## Materials and Processes Terms

**Cryo-Compatible Material:** Material suitable for cryogenic service, maintaining mechanical properties at extremely low temperatures (e.g., 316L stainless steel, Inconel, aluminum alloys).

**Brittle Fracture:** Sudden failure occurring when materials lose ductility at low temperatures.

**Inerting:** Displacement of oxygen-containing atmosphere with inert gas (nitrogen, argon) to prevent combustion hazards.

**Purge:** Flow of gas through a system to remove contaminants or undesirable atmospheres.

**LOTO (Lockout/Tagout):** Safety procedure ensuring equipment is properly shut down and unable to be restarted during maintenance.

## Regulatory and Compliance Terms

**Airworthiness:** Condition where an aircraft or component meets regulatory safety standards for flight operations.

**Type Certificate:** FAA/EASA approval certifying an aircraft design meets airworthiness requirements.

**STC (Supplemental Type Certificate):** Approval for a modification to a type-certificated aircraft.

**FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis):** Systematic method for identifying potential failures and their consequences.

**Engineering Disposition:** Formal decision on nonconforming material (use-as-is, repair, scrap, rework).

## Measurement Units

**Pressure:**
- bar (1 bar = 100 kPa = 14.5 psi)
- psi (pounds per square inch)
- MPa (megapascal)

**Temperature:**
- °C (Celsius)
- K (Kelvin)
- °F (Fahrenheit)

**Volume:**
- L (liters)
- gal (gallons)
- m³ (cubic meters)

**Leak Rate:**
- mbar·L/s (millibar-liters per second)
- std cc/s (standard cubic centimeters per second)
- atm·cc/s (atmosphere-cubic centimeters per second)
