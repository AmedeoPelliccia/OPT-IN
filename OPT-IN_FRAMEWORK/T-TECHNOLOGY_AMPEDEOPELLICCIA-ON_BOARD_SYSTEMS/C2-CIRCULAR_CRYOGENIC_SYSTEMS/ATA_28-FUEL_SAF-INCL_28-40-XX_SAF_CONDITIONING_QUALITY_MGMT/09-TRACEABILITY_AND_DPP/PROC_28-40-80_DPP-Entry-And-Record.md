# PROC_28-40-80 â€” Digital Product Passport Entry and Record

Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Cryogenic Systems Engineering

## Purpose

Defines requirements for Digital Product Passport (DPP) entries to ensure complete lifecycle traceability of cryogenic system components.

## DPP Philosophy

The Digital Product Passport provides a comprehensive digital record of each serialized component from manufacture through end-of-life, including:
- Manufacturing data (PN, SN, materials, processes)
- Test and inspection results
- Maintenance and repair history
- Configuration changes
- Decommissioning data

## Required DPP Entries

### For Each Tank

**Manufacturing:**
- Part number and serial number
- Manufacturing date and location
- Materials (with heat/lot numbers and CoC references)
- Welding procedures and welder qualifications
- Hydrostatic test results
- Vacuum jacket leak test results
- Weight and dimensional inspection

**Installation:**
- Installation date and aircraft MSN
- Installation location (station, zone)
- Interface verification (mounting, plumbing, electrical)

**Service:**
- Fill/defill cycles (cumulative count)
- Periodic inspections (annual, 5-year, 10-year)
- Repairs or modifications
- Nonconformances and dispositions

### For Each Valve/Component

- Part number, serial number, manufacturer
- Material certifications
- Functional test results
- Installation location and date
- Maintenance actions

### For Each Procedure/Test

- Procedure reference (PROC_28-40-XX)
- Execution date and operator
- Results and disposition
- Supporting documents (SHA-256 hashes)

## Data Format

DPP entries should use structured JSON format per DATA_28-40-81 template.

## Security and Integrity

**SHA-256 Hashing:**
All supporting documents (test reports, certificates, inspection photos) must have SHA-256 hash recorded in DPP to ensure data integrity.

**Access Control:**
- Read access: Engineering, Quality, Maintenance
- Write access: Authorized personnel only
- Audit trail: All changes logged with user ID and timestamp

## Retention

DPP data must be retained for:
- Active components: Life of component
- Retired components: Component life + 10 years
- Backup: Redundant storage with disaster recovery
