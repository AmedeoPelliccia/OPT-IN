# DESC_28-40-61 — Emergency Venting and Safety Data Sheet

Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Cryogenic Systems Engineering

## Purpose

Describes emergency venting systems, procedures, and safety data for cryogenic hydrogen and SAF systems.

## Emergency Venting System

**Primary Relief:**
- Spring-loaded pressure relief valves
- Setpoint: 1.1× MAWP (typically 5.5 bar for 5.0 bar MAWP)
- Capacity: Sized for worst-case heat leak + external fire scenario

**Secondary Relief:**
- Burst disk (rupture disk)
- Setpoint: 1.3× MAWP
- Backup protection if primary relief fails

**Vent Routing:**
- Vent gases routed above fuselage or to wing tips
- Discharge point >2m from structure and intakes
- Diffuser or dispersion device to promote mixing

## Emergency Procedures

**LH2 Overpressure:**
1. Activate emergency venting if pressure >1.2× MAWP
2. Evacuate area downwind of vent discharge
3. Monitor hydrogen concentration (LEL detectors)
4. Do not approach until pressure normalized and H₂ <10% LEL

**LH2 Spill/Release:**
1. Evacuate area immediately (100m radius minimum)
2. Eliminate all ignition sources
3. Allow liquid to evaporate (do not attempt containment)
4. Monitor hydrogen levels
5. Ventilate area thoroughly before re-entry

**Fire Involving LH2:**
1. Evacuate immediately
2. Activate aircraft fire suppression
3. Call emergency services
4. Do not attempt to extinguish LH2 flame unless release can be stopped
5. Cool adjacent structures with water spray (from safe distance)

## Safety Data

**Liquid Hydrogen (LH2):**
- Boiling point: -253°C (-423°F) at 1 atm
- Flammability range: 4-75% v/v in air
- Autoignition temperature: 500°C (932°F)
- Minimum ignition energy: 0.02 mJ (extremely low - static spark can ignite)

**Hazards:**
- Extreme cold (cryogenic burns, frostbite, embrittlement)
- Flammability (wide flammable range)
- Asphyxiation (displaces oxygen)
- High expansion ratio (1:848 liquid to gas)

**PPE for LH2:**
- Face shield
- Cryogenic gloves (loose-fitting for quick removal)
- Long sleeves and pants (no pockets or cuffs to trap liquid)
- Safety footwear with metatarsal protection
- Hearing protection (for high-pressure venting)

**SAF Safety Data:**
- Flash point: >38°C (>100°F)
- Autoignition: ~210°C (410°F)
- Flammability: Similar to Jet-A fuel
- Health: Irritant (skin, eyes, respiratory)

## Training Requirements

All personnel working with or near cryogenic systems must complete:
- CRYO-SYS-L2: Cryogenic Systems Safety (8 hours)
- H2-SAFE-01: Hydrogen Safety Awareness (4 hours)
- Annual refresher training
