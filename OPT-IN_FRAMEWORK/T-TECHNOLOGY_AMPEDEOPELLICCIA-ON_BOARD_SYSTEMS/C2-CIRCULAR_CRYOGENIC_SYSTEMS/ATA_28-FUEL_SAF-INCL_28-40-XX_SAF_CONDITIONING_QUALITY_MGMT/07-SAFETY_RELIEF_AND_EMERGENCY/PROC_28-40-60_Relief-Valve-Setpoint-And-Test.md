# PROC_28-40-60 — Relief Valve Setpoint and Test

Revision: 1.0.0
Effective date: 2025-10-30
Owner: Cryogenic Systems Engineering

## Purpose

Procedure for testing and verifying pressure relief valve setpoints on cryogenic hydrogen storage systems.

## Safety Requirements

**Hazards:**
- High pressure
- Rapid gas release
- Cryogenic temperatures
- Hydrogen flammability

**PPE:** Safety glasses, cryogenic gloves, face shield, hearing protection

## Test Method

**Setpoint Verification:**
1. Install relief valve in calibrated test bench
2. Pressurize slowly with nitrogen or helium
3. Record opening pressure (crack pressure)
4. Record closing pressure (reseat pressure)
5. Verify blowdown within specification

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Opening pressure: Design setpoint ±2%
- Blowdown: 5-10% of setpoint
- No leakage at 90% of setpoint

## Documentation

- Relief valve PN, SN, and setpoint
- Test bench calibration certificate
- As-found and as-left pressures
- Pass/fail determination
- Next test due date
- SHA-256 hash of test report

## Test Frequency

- Initial installation: Before service
- Periodic: Every 24 months or per regulation
- After repair: Before return to service
