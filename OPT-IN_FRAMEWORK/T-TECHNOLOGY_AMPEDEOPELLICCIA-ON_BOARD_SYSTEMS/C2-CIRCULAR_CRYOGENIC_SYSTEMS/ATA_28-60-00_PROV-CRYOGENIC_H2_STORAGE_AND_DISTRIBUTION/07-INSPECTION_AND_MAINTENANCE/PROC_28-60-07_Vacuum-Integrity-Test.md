## 1. Purpose

Test procedure to verify vacuum integrity of cryogenic tank insulation space.

---

## 2. Scope

Annual vacuum verification and post-repair vacuum testing.

---

## 3. Safety

- No cryogenic hazard during vacuum testing
- Pressure vessel safety (vacuum loading on outer shell)
- PPE: Safety glasses, gloves

---

## 4. Equipment

- Vacuum pump (capable of <1×10⁻⁵ mbar)
- Vacuum gauge (Pirani or cold cathode)
- Helium leak detector (mass spectrometer type)
- Calibrated test equipment (within 6 months)

---

## 5. Procedure

### 5.1 Initial Vacuum Level Check

1. Connect vacuum gauge to tank vacuum port
2. Record initial vacuum level
3. If >1×10⁻⁴ mbar, proceed to pump-down

### 5.2 Pump-Down (if required)

1. Connect vacuum pump to tank
2. Evacuate insulation space
3. Monitor vacuum level continuously
4. Target: <1×10⁻⁴ mbar
5. Typical time: 24-48 hours

### 5.3 Leak-Up Test

1. Isolate tank from pump (close valve)
2. Monitor vacuum level for 1 hour
3. Calculate leak-up rate: Δp/Δt
4. Acceptance: <1×10⁻⁵ mbar/hour

### 5.4 Helium Leak Test (if leak-up excessive)

1. Spray helium around suspected leak areas
2. Monitor helium detector signal
3. Identify leak locations
4. Document for repair

---

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- Final vacuum: ≤1×10⁻⁴ mbar
- Leak-up rate: <1×10⁻⁵ mbar/hour
- No identifiable gross leaks

---

## 7. Disposition

**Pass**: Continue normal operation, retest in 12 months

**Fail**: Engineering review required. Consider:
- Vacuum repump and retest
- Leak repair and retest
- Tank replacement (if vacuum cannot be recovered)
