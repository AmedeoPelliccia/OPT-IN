# PROC_28-60-08 â€” Nonconformance Reporting and Disposition
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Owner:** Quality Assurance / Cryogenic Systems Engineering

---

## 1. Purpose

Procedure for identifying, documenting, and dispositioning nonconformances in cryogenic hydrogen systems.

---

## 2. Scope

Applies to all nonconformances discovered during:
- Manufacturing and assembly
- Inspection and testing
- Maintenance and repair
- In-service operation

---

## 3. Definitions

**Nonconformance (NCR)**: Any condition that does not meet specified requirements

**Disposition**: Engineering decision on how to handle nonconformance
- **Use-As-Is**: No action required, within acceptable limits
- **Rework**: Correct to meet requirements
- **Repair**: Restore to serviceable condition (may not meet original spec)
- **Scrap**: Discard component

---

## 4. Reporting

### 4.1 NCR Initiation

Any person discovering a nonconformance shall:
1. Stop work on affected item
2. Tag item with red "HOLD" tag
3. Notify supervisor and Quality Assurance
4. Initiate NCR form (paper or electronic)

### 4.2 NCR Documentation

Required information:
- NCR number (assigned by QA)
- Date and discoverer
- Component/assembly identification
- Description of nonconformance
- Photographs (if applicable)
- Affected requirements/specifications

---

## 5. Evaluation

### 5.1 Initial Review

Quality Assurance shall:
- Review NCR for completeness
- Assess safety impact
- Determine if flight-critical
- Route to appropriate engineering discipline

### 5.2 Engineering Disposition

Cryogenic Systems Engineering shall:
- Evaluate technical impact
- Determine root cause (if required)
- Propose disposition
- Document technical rationale
- Identify rework/repair procedure (if applicable)

### 5.3 Flight-Critical Items

For flight-critical nonconformances:
- Safety Engineering review required
- Chief Engineer approval required
- Customer notification (if contractually required)
- Certification authority notification (if airworthiness impact)

---

## 6. Disposition Actions

### 6.1 Use-As-Is

Acceptable when:
- Nonconformance is within engineering tolerance
- No safety impact
- No performance impact
- Engineering justification documented

### 6.2 Rework

- Return item to conforming condition
- Follow original manufacturing procedures
- Re-inspect per original acceptance criteria
- Close NCR after verification

### 6.3 Repair

- Engineering repair procedure required
- May include:
  - Weld repair per AWS D10.11
  - Seal replacement
  - Component changeout
- NDT and pressure testing after repair
- Document repair in component history

### 6.4 Scrap

When repair/rework not feasible:
- Component destroyed or marked permanently
- Traceability maintained
- Root cause analysis for systemic issues

---

## 7. Closure

### 7.1 Verification

Quality Assurance shall verify:
- Disposition action completed per engineering authorization
- Re-inspection passed (if applicable)
- Documentation complete
- Item released from hold

### 7.2 Record Retention

- NCR records retained permanently
- Linked to component serial number
- Included in aircraft records
- Available for audits and certification

---

## 8. Trending and Corrective Action

### 8.1 NCR Trending

Quality Assurance shall:
- Track NCRs by type, cause, component
- Identify repeat issues
- Report trends monthly

### 8.2 Corrective Action

For systemic issues:
- Root cause analysis required
- Corrective action plan developed
- Implementation and verification
- Effectiveness review after 6 months
