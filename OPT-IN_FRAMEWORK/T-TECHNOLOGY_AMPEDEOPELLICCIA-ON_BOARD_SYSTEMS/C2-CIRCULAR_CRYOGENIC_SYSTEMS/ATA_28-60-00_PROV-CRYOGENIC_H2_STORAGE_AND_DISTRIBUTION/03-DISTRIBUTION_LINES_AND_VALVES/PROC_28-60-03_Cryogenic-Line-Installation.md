## 1. Purpose

Installation and pressure testing procedure for vacuum-jacketed cryogenic hydrogen distribution lines.

---

## 2. Scope

Covers installation of vacuum-jacketed lines from tank to propulsion system interface.

---

## 3. Safety

⚠️ **DANGER**: Cryogenic temperatures (-253°C) and high-pressure hydrogen.

- PPE: Cryogenic gloves, face shield, safety glasses
- No ignition sources within 25 feet
- Adequate ventilation required
- Hydrogen detection system active

---

## 4. Prerequisites

- Line sections inspected and cleaned per ASTM G93
- Orbital welding equipment calibrated
- Welders certified for cryogenic welding (AWS D10.11)
- Helium leak test equipment calibrated
- Vacuum pump available
- Work area prepared with fire extinguisher and H₂ detector

---

## 5. Installation Procedure

### 5.1 Preparation

1. Verify line routing per installation drawing
2. Check support locations and clearances
3. Verify flange cleanliness (white glove test)
4. Inspect gaskets and seals (PTFE or Vespel)

### 5.2 Assembly

1. Position line sections with supports
2. Align flanges (±0.5 mm offset, ±0.5° angular)
3. Install gaskets (do not reuse)
4. Torque bolts per specification (star pattern, 3 passes)
5. For welded joints:
   - Purge with argon (≥99.999% purity)
   - Tack weld at 4 points
   - Complete orbital weld per WPS
   - Maintain interpass temperature <50°C
   - Visual inspect weld (100% acceptance)

### 5.3 Support Installation

1. Install low-heat-leak supports at design intervals
2. G-10 or similar insulating material
3. Allow for thermal contraction (no rigid constraints)
4. Verify no mechanical loads on connections

## 6. Pressure Testing

### 6.1 Inner Line Test

1. Isolate inner line from tank and downstream equipment
2. Evacuate air and backfill with helium
3. Pressurize to 1.5× design pressure (18 bar for 12 bar design)
4. Hold 10 minutes
5. Leak test all joints with helium detector
6. Acceptance: ≤1×10⁻⁶ mbar·L/s

### 6.2 Vacuum Jacket Test

1. Connect vacuum pump to jacket port
2. Pump down to <1×10⁻⁴ mbar
3. Isolate and monitor leak-up rate
4. Acceptance: <1×10⁻⁵ mbar/hour leak-up

---

## 7. Acceptance

- No leaks detected
- Vacuum performance met
- Support alignment verified
- Documentation complete

---

## 8. References

- AWS D10.11: Cryogenic welding
- ASTM G93: Oxygen/hydrogen cleaning
- ASME B31.3: Process piping
