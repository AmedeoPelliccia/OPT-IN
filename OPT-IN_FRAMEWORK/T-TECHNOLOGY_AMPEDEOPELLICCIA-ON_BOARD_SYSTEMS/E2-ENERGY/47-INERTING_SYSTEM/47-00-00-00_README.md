# ATA 47-00-00-00 - INERTING SYSTEM

## Chapter Overview

The Inerting System (ATA 47) provides nitrogen-enriched air to fuel tanks to prevent combustion by reducing oxygen concentration below flammable limits. This system is critical for fuel tank safety, especially for large commercial aircraft.

## System Description

The inerting system continuously monitors and controls the oxygen concentration in fuel tanks during all phases of flight, from takeoff through landing. It generates nitrogen-enriched air (NEA) through air separation modules and distributes it to designated fuel tanks.

## Key Components

- **Control LRU** (Hardware 470001): Main system controller
- **Flight Deck Panel** (Hardware 470002): Crew interface and controls
- **Service Panel** (Hardware 470003): Ground maintenance interface
- **Data Logger** (Hardware 470004): System data recording unit
- **Mounting Rack** (Hardware 470005): Equipment mounting infrastructure
- **Ground Purge Cart** (Hardware 470006): Ground support equipment
