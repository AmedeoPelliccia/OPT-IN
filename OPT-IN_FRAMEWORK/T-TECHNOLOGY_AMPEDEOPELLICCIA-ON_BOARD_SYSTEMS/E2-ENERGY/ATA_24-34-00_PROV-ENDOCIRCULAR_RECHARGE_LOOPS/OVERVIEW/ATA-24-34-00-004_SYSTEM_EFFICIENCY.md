## Efficiency Breakdown

### Component-Level Efficiency

| Component | Charging Mode | Discharging Mode | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|-------|
| Bidirectional Converter | 96.2% | 94.8% | SiC MOSFETs, 50 kHz |
| Input/Output Filters | 99.1% | 99.1% | LC topology |
| Cabling & Connectors | 99.5% | 99.5% | 2.5m run, AWG 2/0 |
| Battery Chemistry | 98.0% | 98.5% | Solid-CO₂ tech |
| Control Electronics | 99.8% | 99.8% | < 100W consumption |
| **System Total** | **92.7%** | **91.8%** | Product of components |

### Round-Trip Efficiency

```
η_round-trip = η_charging × η_discharging
η_round-trip = 0.927 × 0.918 = 85.1%
```

**Target**: > 85% (Achieved)  
**Stretch Goal**: > 90% (Development ongoing)

## Loss Analysis

### Conduction Losses

**Switching devices** (largest contributor):

```
P_cond = I²_RMS × R_DS(on) × N_devices
P_cond = (200A)² × 8mΩ × 8 devices = 2.56 kW @ full load
```

Efficiency impact: 2.56 kW / 50 kW = 5.1% loss

**Mitigation**:
- SiC devices (vs. Si: -60% R_DS(on))
- Parallel devices to share current
- Active cooling to minimize R_DS(on) temp coefficient

### Switching Losses

**MOSFET switching**:

```
P_sw = 0.5 × V_DS × I_D × (t_rise + t_fall) × f_sw × N_devices
P_sw = 0.5 × 280V × 200A × 200ns × 50kHz × 8 = 2.24 kW
```

Efficiency impact: 2.24 kW / 50 kW = 4.5% loss

**Mitigation**:
- Soft-switching (ZVS/ZCS techniques)
- Optimized gate driver design
- Snubber circuits for voltage spikes

### Magnetic Core Losses

**Transformer core loss**:

```
P_core = k × f^α × B^β × V_core
P_core = 150 mW/cm³ × Volume = 450W
```

Efficiency impact: 450W / 50 kW = 0.9% loss

**Mitigation**:
- Nanocrystalline core material
- Optimal flux density operation (0.15T)
- Temperature management
