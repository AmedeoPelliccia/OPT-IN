## Energy Recovery Opportunities

### Flight Phase Analysis

| Flight Phase | Duration (min) | Available Energy (kWh) | Recoverable (kWh) | Recovery Rate (%) |
|--------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Descent | 15 | 12.5 | 9.4 | 75% |
| Approach | 8 | 5.2 | 3.6 | 69% |
| Landing | 3 | 2.8 | 1.9 | 68% |
| Taxi-in | 5 | 1.5 | 0.9 | 60% |
| **Total** | **31** | **22.0** | **15.8** | **72%** |

### Electrical Braking Events

When electrical loads are shed or reduced rapidly:

**Energy Available per Event**:
- Load shed 20 kW: 5.6 kWh over 1 minute
- Generator margin: 3.2 kWh per event
- Total events per flight: 4-6 typical

**Recovery Efficiency**: 75% ± 3%

## System Performance Modeling

### Energy Balance Model

```
E_recovered = ∫[P_available(t) × η_converter × η_battery × duty_cycle(t)]dt
```

Where:
- P_available: Excess generation capacity (kW)
- η_converter: Conversion efficiency (0.95)
- η_battery: Battery charging efficiency (0.97)
- duty_cycle: Operating duty cycle

### Mission Profile Analysis

**Typical 2-hour flight**:
- Total electrical energy consumed: 85 kWh
- Energy recovered: 15.8 kWh
- Net energy from generators: 69.2 kWh
- **System benefit**: 18.6% reduction in generator output

## Fuel Savings Analysis

### Direct Fuel Savings

Generator fuel consumption: 0.28 kg/kWh

**Fuel saved per flight**:
```
Fuel_saved = E_recovered × SFC_generator
Fuel_saved = 15.8 kWh × 0.28 kg/kWh = 4.4 kg
```

**Annual savings** (500 flights):
- Fuel: 2,200 kg (2.4 metric tons)
- Cost savings: $2,640 @ $1.20/kg
- CO₂ reduction: 6.93 metric tons

### Indirect Benefits

1. **Generator life extension**: Reduced operating hours = 8% longer TBO
2. **Battery optimization**: Controlled charging extends battery life 30%
3. **Load management**: Peak shaving reduces generator size requirements
