## Concept Overview

The **Endocircular Principle** represents a paradigm shift in aircraft electrical energy management by creating closed-loop energy pathways that enable bidirectional power flow and regenerative energy capture. Unlike traditional linear energy distribution systems, endocircular systems form continuous energy cycles that minimize losses and maximize utilization.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Energy Flow Topology

Traditional aircraft electrical systems follow a unidirectional energy flow:

```
Generators → Distribution → Loads → Heat (waste)
```

The endocircular approach introduces bidirectional energy paths:

```
        ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
        │                                     │
Generators ◄─► Distribution ◄─► Storage ◄─► Loads
        │                                     │
        └─────────────────────────────────────┘
              (Regenerative Feedback Loop)
```

### Core Principles

1. **Bidirectional Power Flow**
   - Energy can flow in both directions through conversion paths
   - Enables both charging and discharging operations
   - Requires active control and synchronization

2. **Regenerative Capture**
   - Electrical braking energy recovery
   - Load shedding energy preservation
   - Descent phase energy collection

3. **Dynamic Load Leveling**
   - Smooths generator load variations
   - Reduces peak power demands
   - Optimizes generator operating points

4. **Energy Arbitrage**
   - Stores energy during low-cost periods
   - Discharges during high-value periods
   - Maximizes overall system efficiency

## Mathematical Model

### Energy Balance Equation

The fundamental energy balance for the endocircular system:

```
E_stored(t+Δt) = E_stored(t) + ∫[P_charge(τ)·η_charge - P_discharge(τ)/η_discharge]dτ
```

Where:
- `E_stored`: Energy in storage (Wh)
- `P_charge`: Charging power (W)
- `P_discharge`: Discharging power (W)
- `η_charge`: Charging efficiency (0.95-0.97)
- `η_discharge`: Discharging efficiency (0.93-0.95)

### Efficiency Optimization

Total system efficiency:

```
η_total = η_converter · η_filter · η_thermal · η_control
```

Target: **η_total ≥ 0.95** for charging mode

## Operational Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Regenerative Descent

During aircraft descent, reduced electrical loads combined with continued generator operation create excess capacity:

**Energy Flow**:
1. Generators operate at reduced load
2. Excess capacity directed to ERL system
3. Energy stored in battery system
4. Fuel consumption reduced via generator load optimization

**Benefit**: 2-3% fuel savings per flight

### Scenario 2: Electrical Braking

When electrical loads are shed or reduced rapidly:

**Energy Flow**:
1. Sudden load reduction detected
2. ERL system absorbs excess generation
3. Energy captured before dissipation
4. Later reused for normal operations

**Benefit**: 5-8 kWh captured per braking event

### Scenario 3: Peak Load Support

During high-demand phases (takeoff, climb, icing conditions):

**Energy Flow**:
1. Generator load approaching maximum
2. ERL system provides supplemental power
3. Peak demand met without oversizing generators
4. System weight and cost optimized

**Benefit**: 50-100 kg weight savings in generation system
