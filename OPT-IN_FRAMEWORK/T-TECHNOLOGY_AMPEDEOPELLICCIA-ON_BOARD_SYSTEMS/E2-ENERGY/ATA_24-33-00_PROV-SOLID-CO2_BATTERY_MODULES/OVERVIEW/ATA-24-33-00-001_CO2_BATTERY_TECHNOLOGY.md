## Technology Foundation

### 1. CO2 Electrochemistry

#### 1.1 Basic Operating Principle

The solid-state CO2 battery operates through reversible electrochemical reactions involving carbon dioxide at the cathode:

**Discharge Reaction (Cathode):**
```
CO2 + 4e⁻ → C + 2O²⁻
```

**Charge Reaction (Cathode):**
```
C + 2O²⁻ → CO2 + 4e⁻
```

**Anode Reaction (Lithium metal):**
```
Li ⇌ Li⁺ + e⁻
```

**Overall Cell Reaction:**
```
4Li + CO2 ⇌ 2Li2O + C
```

#### 1.2 Thermodynamic Properties
