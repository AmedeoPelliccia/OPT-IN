## Safety Assessment Approach

### Hazard Analysis
- Functional Hazard Assessment (FHA)
- Preliminary System Safety Assessment (PSSA)
- System Safety Assessment (SSA)
- Common Cause Analysis (CCA)

### DO-178C Compliance
- Design Assurance Level A requirements
- Software lifecycle documentation
- Verification objectives
- Configuration management

### DO-297 Integration
- IMA safety assessment processes
- Partition isolation verification
- Resource management safety
- Fault containment analysis

## Formal Methods

- Model checking for temporal properties
- Static analysis for code verification
- Abstract interpretation
- Proof obligations
