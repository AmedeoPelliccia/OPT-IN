## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the scope, governance structure, and effectivity for the ATA 42-60-00 Quantum-Inspired Scheduler and Resource Orchestration system. The system extends traditional ARINC 653 partition scheduling with quantum-inspired optimization algorithms to achieve optimal resource utilization while maintaining real-time guarantees and safety-critical requirements.

### 1.2 System Boundaries

**In Scope:**
- Quantum-inspired scheduling algorithms (simulated annealing, quantum annealing, hybrid approaches)
- Multi-objective optimization (performance, power, thermal, fairness)
- Real-time constraint enforcement (WCET, deadlines, temporal isolation)
- Resource orchestration and allocation policies
- Integration with ARINC 653 Core OS services
- Safety-critical software development (DAL A)
- Simulation and verification framework
- Hardware-in-Loop testing integration

**Out of Scope:**
- ARINC 653 Core OS implementation (covered by ATA 42 Core Software)
- Hardware platform design (covered by ATA 42 Hardware Modules)
- Network fabric implementation (covered by ATA 42 Network Fabric)
- Application partition software (covered by respective ATA chapters)

### 1.3 Technology Readiness Level

**Current TRL**: 3-4 (Proof of Concept / Laboratory Validation)  
**Target TRL**: 8-9 (Flight Qualified / Flight Proven)

This is a **provisional** ATA chapter subject to:
- Algorithm validation and verification
- Safety assessment and hazard analysis
- Regulatory authority review and approval
- Certification basis establishment

## 3. Effectivity

### 3.1 Aircraft Applicability

**Aircraft Type**: AMPEL360  
**MSN Applicability**: ALL (subject to configuration control)  
**Configuration**: All configurations with IMA advanced scheduling capabilities

### 3.2 Software Effectivity

| Component | Version | Effectivity Date | Status |
|-----------|---------|------------------|--------|
| Quantum Scheduler Core | 0.1.0 | 2025-10-30 | Development |
| Simulation Framework | 0.1.0 | 2025-10-30 | Development |
| Policy Engine | 0.1.0 | 2025-10-30 | Development |

### 3.3 Hardware Dependencies

**Minimum Platform Requirements:**
- ARINC 653 Part 1/2 compliant IMA Core OS
- Multi-core processor with hardware scheduling support
- Memory protection unit (MPU) for spatial isolation
- Hardware timers with microsecond resolution
- Sufficient computational capacity for optimization algorithms (TBD based on WCET analysis)

## 4. Regulatory and Standards Compliance

### 4.1 Applicable Regulations

- **EASA**: CS-25 (Large Aeroplanes)
- **FAA**: 14 CFR Part 25
- **ICAO**: Annex 8 (Airworthiness of Aircraft)

### 4.2 Applicable Standards

| Standard | Title | Applicability |
|----------|-------|---------------|
| RTCA DO-178C | Software Considerations in Airborne Systems | DAL A software lifecycle |
| RTCA DO-254 | Hardware Considerations | Hardware integration |
| RTCA DO-297 | IMA Development Guidance | IMA-specific guidance |
| RTCA DO-330 | Software Tool Qualification | Development tools |
| RTCA DO-160G | Environmental Conditions | Environmental testing |
| ARINC 653 P1/P2 | Avionics Application Software Standard | Core OS interface |
| EUROCAE ED-12C | Software Aspects of Certification | European equivalent to DO-178C |
| EUROCAE ED-202A | MILS Architecture | Security architecture |
| EUROCAE ED-203 | Airborne Security | Security requirements |

### 4.3 Design Assurance Level

**Target DAL**: Level A (Failure Catastrophic)

**Rationale**: The quantum scheduler directly affects partition scheduling, which is critical for ensuring temporal isolation of safety-critical functions. Failure of the scheduler could lead to:
- Partition timing violations
- Resource starvation of safety-critical tasks
- Loss of temporal isolation guarantees
- Cascading failures affecting multiple aircraft systems
