# 01-GENERAL

## Overview

This section contains governance, scope, effectivity, and regulatory compliance documentation for the ATA 42-60-00 Quantum-Inspired Scheduler and Resource Orchestration system.

## Contents

### Documents

- **[DESC_42-60-01_Scope-Governance-And-Effectivity.md](DESC_42-60-01_Scope-Governance-And-Effectivity.md)**: Defines the scope, governance structure, roles and responsibilities, and aircraft effectivity for the quantum scheduler framework.

### Data Files

- **[DATA_42-60-02_Regulatory-Compliance-Matrix.csv](DATA_42-60-02_Regulatory-Compliance-Matrix.csv)**: Maps system requirements to applicable regulatory standards ([DO-178C](https://www.rtca.org/content/standards-guidance-materials), [DO-297](https://www.rtca.org/content/standards-guidance-materials), [ARINC 653](https://www.aviation-ia.com/standards/arinc-653/), etc.).

- **[DATA_42-60-03_Effectivity-And-Config.csv](DATA_42-60-03_Effectivity-And-Config.csv)**: Documents aircraft configurations, MSN applicability, and software version effectivity.

## Purpose

The GENERAL section establishes the foundational documentation required for:
- Defining project scope and boundaries
- Establishing governance and oversight
- Documenting regulatory compliance approach
- Tracking configuration effectivity
- Supporting certification activities
