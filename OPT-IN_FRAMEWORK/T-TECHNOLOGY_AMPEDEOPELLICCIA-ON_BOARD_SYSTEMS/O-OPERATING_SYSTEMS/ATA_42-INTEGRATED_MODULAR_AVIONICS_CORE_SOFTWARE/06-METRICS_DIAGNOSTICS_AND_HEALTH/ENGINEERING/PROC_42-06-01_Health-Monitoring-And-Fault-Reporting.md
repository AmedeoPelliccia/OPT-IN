# PROC_42-06-01: Health Monitoring and Fault Reporting

## Purpose
Define health monitoring strategy and fault reporting procedures.

## Health Metrics
1. **Partition Metrics**: CPU usage, memory usage, deadline violations
2. **System Metrics**: Overall CPU, memory, temperature, voltage
3. **Communication Metrics**: IPC errors, message drops, timeouts
4. **Security Metrics**: Authentication failures, integrity violations

## Fault Detection
- Threshold-based detection (warning, critical, fatal levels)
- Trend analysis for predictive maintenance
- Anomaly detection algorithms

## Fault Reporting
- Health events logged to system log
- Critical faults reported to maintenance system (ATA 45)
- Fault codes per DATA_42-06-02_Health-Metric-Definitions.csv

## Error Handling Actions
- LOG: Record event only
- IDLE: Stop partition execution
- RESTART: Restart partition (warm/cold start)
- RESET: Reset entire system
