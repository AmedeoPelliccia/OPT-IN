## Purpose
Define software verification procedures ensuring requirements coverage and DO-178C compliance.

## Verification Levels
1. **Unit Testing**: Component-level verification
2. **Integration Testing**: Interface and interaction verification
3. **System Testing**: End-to-end functional verification
4. **Requirements-Based Testing**: Direct requirement validation
5. **Structural Coverage**: Statement, branch, and MC/DC coverage

## Traceability
