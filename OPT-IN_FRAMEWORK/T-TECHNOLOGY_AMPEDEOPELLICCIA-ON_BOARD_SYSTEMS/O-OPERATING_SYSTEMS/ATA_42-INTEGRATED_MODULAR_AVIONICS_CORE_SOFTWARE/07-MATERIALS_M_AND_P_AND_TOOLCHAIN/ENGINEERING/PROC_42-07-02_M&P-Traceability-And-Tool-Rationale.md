Establish materials and processes traceability for Core OS development toolchain.

## Tool Selection Rationale
- **GCC 10.3**: Mature, widely-used, extensive qualification evidence
- **Coverity**: Industry-leading static analysis, DO-330 qualified
- **gcov**: Integrated with GCC, proven for structural coverage

## Traceability
- Tool version locked in build scripts
- Tool binaries checksummed (SHA-256)
- Qualification evidence linked in DATA_42-07-01

## Change Control
Tool version changes require:
1. Tool re-qualification or qualification evidence review
2. Regression testing of Core OS
3. Configuration management board approval

## Revision
Version 1.0.0, 2025-10-30
