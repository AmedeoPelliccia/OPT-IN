# TESTPLAN_16-03-01 — Functional Regression Test Plan

**Document ID:** TESTPLAN_16-03-01  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**ATA Chapter:** 16 — Change of Role

## Purpose

This test plan provides a standardized framework for validating role changes through functional, integration, and regression testing to ensure safe operation and compliance with acceptance criteria.

## Scope

This plan applies to all role changes requiring test evidence as defined in change request assessments. Test types include:
- **Functional Tests** — Verify new or changed functionality operates correctly
- **Integration Tests** — Verify interfaces with other systems are not adversely affected
- **Regression Tests** — Verify existing functionality remains unaffected by the change

## Test Strategy

### Test Levels

1. **Component Level** — Individual equipment or subsystem testing
2. **System Level** — Complete system testing with interfaces
3. **Aircraft Level** — Integration with aircraft systems (ground or flight test)

### Test Environment

- **Laboratory** — Controlled environment with test equipment
- **Ground Test** — Aircraft on ground with power and systems active
- **Flight Test** — In-flight testing under operational conditions

### Test Articles

Specify for each test:
- Aircraft MSN (if aircraft-level test)
- Component part number and serial number
- Configuration state
- Software/firmware versions
- Test fixture or simulator (if applicable)

## Test Prerequisites

Before testing begins, verify:
- [ ] Change request approved
- [ ] Safety assessment completed and mitigations in place
- [ ] Test procedures approved
- [ ] Test article configured correctly
- [ ] Test equipment calibrated (calibration due date verified)
- [ ] Personnel qualified and briefed
- [ ] Safety precautions established
- [ ] Data recording systems operational
- [ ] Acceptance criteria defined and documented

## Test Objectives

Define specific test objectives for each change. Template:

| Objective ID | Objective Description | Success Criteria | Test Type | Test Level |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------|-----------|------------|
| OBJ-001 | Verify [function] operates correctly in [new role] | [Measurable criteria] | Functional | System |
| OBJ-002 | Verify interface with [system] not adversely affected | No errors, normal operation | Integration | Aircraft |
| OBJ-003 | Verify [existing function] operates normally after change | [Baseline performance maintained] | Regression | System |

## Acceptance Criteria

### Numeric Criteria

All numeric measurements must be documented with:
- Parameter name
- Threshold (min/max acceptable values)
- Unit of measurement
- Tolerance
- Pass/Fail determination

Example:

| Parameter | Threshold_Min | Threshold_Max | Unit | Tolerance | Pass_Fail_Criteria |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|------|-----------|-------------------|
| Torque | 15.0 | 20.0 | Nm | ±0.5 | Within threshold ± tolerance |
| Deflection | -5.0 | 5.0 | mm | ±0.2 | Within threshold ± tolerance |
| Voltage | 110.0 | 118.0 | V | ±1.0 | Within threshold ± tolerance |

Document numeric criteria in `DATA_16-03-02_Test-Results.csv` with measured values.

### Functional Criteria

For non-numeric tests:
- Expected behavior or result
- Observable indicators of success/failure
- Repeatability requirements (if applicable)
