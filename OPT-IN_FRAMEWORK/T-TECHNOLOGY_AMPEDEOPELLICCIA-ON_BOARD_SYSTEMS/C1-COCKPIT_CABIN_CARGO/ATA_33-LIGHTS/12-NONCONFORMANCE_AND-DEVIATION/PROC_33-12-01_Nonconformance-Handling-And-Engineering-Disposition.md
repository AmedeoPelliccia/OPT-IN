## 1. Scope
Handling of nonconformances (NCRs) and engineering dispositions for lighting systems.
## 2. When to Open NCR
- Part does not meet specification
- Damage discovered during inspection
- Functional test failure
- Photometric test out-of-limits
- Safety-critical defect
## 3. NCR Process
### 3.1 Initiation
1. Inspector/technician discovers nonconformance
2. Tag part "HOLD - NCR"
3. Open NCR in tracking system (or use DATA_33-12-02 template)
4. Document defect with photos

1. Engineering reviews NCR
2. Determines disposition:
   - **Use-As-Is:** Acceptable with waiver
   - **Rework:** Repair per approved procedure
   - **Return to Supplier:** Reject, return for credit/replacement
   - **Scrap:** Destroy, cannot be used

- Safety-critical dispositions require airworthiness approval
- Dispositions affecting type design require DER/DAR or authority approval
## 4. Use-As-Is Criteria
May be acceptable if:
- Defect does not affect safety or function
- Illuminance within 10% of lower limit
- Cosmetic defect not visible in service
- Engineering analysis shows acceptable
## 5. Rework
