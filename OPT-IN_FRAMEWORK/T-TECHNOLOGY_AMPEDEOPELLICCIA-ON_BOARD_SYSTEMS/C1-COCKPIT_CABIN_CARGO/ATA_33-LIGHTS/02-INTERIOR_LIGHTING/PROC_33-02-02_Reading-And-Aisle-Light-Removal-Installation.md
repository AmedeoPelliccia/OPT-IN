## 1. Scope
Procedure for removal and installation of cabin reading lights and aisle lights.

## 2. References
- AMM 33-11-00 (Reading Lights)
- AMM 33-12-00 (Aisle Lights)
- ATA-20 Standard Practices
- DATA_33-02-03 (Illuminance Limits)

## 3. Tools and Equipment
- Phillips screwdriver
- Flat-blade screwdriver
- Torque wrench (5-15 in-lbs)
- Multimeter
- Photometric meter (if functional test required)
- ESD wrist strap

## 4. Safety and Precautions
- **CAUTION:** Ensure aircraft power OFF or circuit breaker OPEN before work
- **CAUTION:** Use ESD protection when handling LED modules
- **WARNING:** Do not look directly into LED light when powered

## 5. Removal Procedure

### 5.1 Reading Light Removal
1. Open circuit breaker for reading light circuit
2. Remove lens cover (quarter-turn or snap-fit, depending on model)
3. Disconnect electrical connector
4. Remove mounting screws (typically 2-4 screws)
5. Extract light assembly
6. Inspect mounting area for corrosion or damage
7. Cap electrical connector if not immediately installing replacement

### 5.2 Aisle Light Removal
1. Open circuit breaker for aisle light circuit
2. Remove trim panel or access door
3. Disconnect electrical connector
4. Remove mounting fasteners
5. Extract light assembly
6. Inspect housing and seal

## 6. Installation Procedure

### 6.1 Pre-Installation Checks
- Verify replacement part number matches IPC
- Inspect new unit for damage
- Check seal/gasket condition

### 6.2 Reading Light Installation
1. Position light assembly in mounting location
2. Connect electrical connector (ensure positive click/lock)
3. Install mounting screws, torque per specification (typically 8-12 in-lbs)
4. Install lens cover
5. Close circuit breaker
6. Perform functional test (see Section 7)

### 6.2 Aisle Light Installation
1. Install new seal/gasket if required
2. Position light assembly
3. Connect electrical connector
4. Install mounting fasteners, torque per specification
5. Install trim panel or access door
6. Close circuit breaker
7. Perform functional test

## 7. Functional Test

### 7.1 Basic Functional Test
1. Apply power (close circuit breaker)
2. Verify light illuminates
3. Check dimming function (if applicable)
4. Verify no flicker or abnormal noise
5. Verify switch operation

### 7.2 Photometric Verification (if required)
1. Allow 5-minute warmup
2. Measure illuminance at specified distance
3. Compare to DATA_33-02-03 limits
4. Document results in work order

## 8. Completion

- Document work in aircraft log
- Record part numbers (removed and installed)
- Record serial numbers if serialized
- Inspector sign-off per regulatory requirements

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Probable Cause | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Light does not illuminate | Power supply failure | Check circuit breaker, wiring |
| Flicker | Loose connection, driver issue | Check connections, replace driver |
| Dim output | LED degradation | Replace LED module |
| Intermittent operation | Poor contact | Clean/reseat connector |
