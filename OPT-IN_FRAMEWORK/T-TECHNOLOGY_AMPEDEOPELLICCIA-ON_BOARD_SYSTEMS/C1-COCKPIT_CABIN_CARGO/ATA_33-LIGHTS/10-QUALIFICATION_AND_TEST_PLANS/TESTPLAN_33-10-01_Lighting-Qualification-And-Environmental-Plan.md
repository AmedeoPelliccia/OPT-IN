## 1. Purpose
Qualification testing plan for new lighting equipment per DO-160G.
## 2. Test Sequence
1. Pre-conditioning inspection
2. Temperature and Altitude (DO-160G Section 4)
3. Temperature Variation (DO-160G Section 5)
4. Vibration (DO-160G Section 8)
5. Power Input (DO-160G Section 16)
6. Voltage Spike (DO-160G Section 17)
7. Lightning Induced Transients (DO-160G Section 22)
8. Post-test functional verification
9. Photometric verification
## 3. Environmental Categories
- **Temperature:** Category A3 (-55°C to +85°C typical)
- **Altitude:** Category A (0 to 55,000 ft)
- **Vibration:** Category U (standard aircraft)
## 4. Pass/Fail Criteria
- **Pass:** Unit operates within specification throughout test, no damage after test
- **Fail:** Unit fails to operate, exceeds limits, or shows damage
## 5. Test Lab
- Use DO-160G accredited test laboratory
- Test report with SHA-256 hash required
## 6. Lifetime Testing
