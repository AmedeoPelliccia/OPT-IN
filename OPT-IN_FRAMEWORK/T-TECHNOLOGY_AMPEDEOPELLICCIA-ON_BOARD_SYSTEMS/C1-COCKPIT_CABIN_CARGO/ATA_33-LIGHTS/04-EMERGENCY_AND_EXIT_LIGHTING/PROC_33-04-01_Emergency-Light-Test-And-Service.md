### Document Control
- **Document ID:** PROC_33-04-01
- **Revision:** A
- **Effective Date:** 2025-10-28

## 1. Scope
Testing and servicing of emergency floor path lights and battery-powered emergency systems.

## 2. Regulatory Requirements
- **[FAA 14 CFR 25.812](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-25/subpart-D/section-25.812):** Emergency lighting
- **Minimum Illuminance:** 0.05 lux at floor level
- **Duration:** 10 minutes minimum after loss of normal power
- **Test Interval:** Per aircraft maintenance schedule (typically annual or per flight hours)

## 3. Tools and Equipment
- Photometric light meter (0.01 lux resolution)
- Stopwatch or timer
- Multimeter
- Battery load tester (for replaceable battery systems)

## 4. Test Procedure

### 4.1 Pre-Test Checks
1. Verify emergency lighting system is in normal operating mode
2. Record aircraft total time/cycles
3. Verify test equipment calibration current

### 4.2 Emergency Mode Activation Test
1. Simulate loss of normal power (pull circuit breaker or use test switch)
2. Verify emergency lights illuminate within 10 seconds
3. Start timer

### 4.3 Illuminance Measurement
1. Allow 1-minute stabilization
2. Measure illuminance at floor level along escape path
3. Record measurements at representative points (minimum 5 points per aisle)
4. **Acceptance:** All readings ≥0.05 lux

### 4.4 Duration Test
1. Continue emergency operation
2. Monitor illuminance every 2 minutes
3. **Acceptance:** Illuminance ≥0.05 lux for full 10 minutes

### 4.5 Post-Test
1. Restore normal power
2. Verify emergency system recharges (charging indicator ON)
3. Record results in aircraft log

## 5. Battery Service (if applicable)

### 5.1 Battery Inspection
- Check for swelling, leakage, corrosion
- Verify mounting secure
- Check connections tight

### 5.2 Battery Replacement Criteria
- Fails duration test
- Visible damage or leakage
- Manufacturer shelf-life expired
- Capacity test <80% of rated capacity

### 5.3 Replacement Procedure
1. Open circuit breaker
2. Remove old battery
3. Clean battery compartment
4. Install new battery (observe polarity)
5. Torque connections per spec
6. Record battery lot/date code
7. Perform functional test

## 6. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Probable Cause | Action |
|---------|----------------|--------|
| Lights do not illuminate in emergency mode | Battery depleted, wiring fault | Check battery, wiring |
| Illuminance below 0.05 lux | LED degradation, battery weak | Replace LED or battery |
| Duration <10 minutes | Battery capacity low | Replace battery |
| Slow recharge | Charger fault | Test charger output, replace if needed |

## 7. Documentation
- Record test results (illuminance readings, duration)
- Record battery information if replaced
- Inspector sign-off
