## Purpose
Provide governance, evidence and traceability for all artifacts that convey information to flightcrew or cabin-crew. Ensure that displays, alerts and procedures meet safety, usability and certification requirements and that changes are auditable.

## Regulatory & Certification
Capture applicable regulatory material and means of compliance. Typical refs and evidence:
- **[14 CFR Part 25](https://www.ecfr.gov/current/title-14/chapter-I/subchapter-C/part-25)** requirements that touch flight-deck displays, crew interfaces, alerts and operational procedures
- **[EASA CS-25](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes)** ‚Äî European certification requirements
- Human factors guidance and means of compliance used for certification
- **[DO-178C](https://www.rtca.org/)** ‚Äî Software considerations for avionics and display systems
- **[DO-254](https://www.rtca.org/)** ‚Äî Hardware design assurance for electronic displays
- **ARINC** specifications for avionics interfaces and data buses
- **EUROCAE** guidance for aircraft systems certification

## Mandatory evidence
- **Design artifacts**: display specifications, annunciator logic, audio cue definitions, wiring/connector refs.  
- **Human factors**: HFE reports, formative/summative usability tests, time-to-action studies, distraction analyses.  
- **Operational procedures**: SOPs, briefings, checklists, abnormal/emergency flows and LOPA impacts.  
- **Software evidence**: verification reports, requirements traceability, test logs for avionics/IFIS/EFIS.  
- **Performance data**: latency, update rate, frame-rate, refresh, annunciator thresholds, audio SPL and intelligibility.  
- **Acceptance**: acceptance criteria, pass/fail results and engineering dispositions for deviations.  
- **Traceability**: sidecars with SHA-256 checksums, drawing refs, and links to ECR/NCRs and LOPA IDs.

## Numeric requirements & examples
Record and verify all numeric thresholds in `DATA_*.csv` files. Typical numeric checks:
- Display luminance and contrast ratios.  
- Minimum readable text size and legibility distances.  
- Audio alert SPL (dBA) and SNR.  
- Annunciator response time and debounce/priority rules.  
- Latency between sensor input and display update (ms).  
- Alert priority timing and suppression windows.

## Effectivity
All artifacts that claim certification or operational coverage must include:
- `msn` (manufacturer serial/aircraft effectivity)  
- `cfg` (configuration identifier)  
- `lopa` (LOPA version)  

## Repository layout (recommended)
- `00_README.md` (this file)

## Core CI / agent checks
1. **Schema validation** for display specs, annunciator config, audio definitions, HFE and procedure artifacts.  
2. **Numeric verification** against `DATA_*.csv`. Flag out-of-range values.  
3. **Human factors completeness**. Ensure HFE reports attach raw data and executive summary.  
4. **Procedure trace**. SOPs must reference affected displays, alerts and LOPA changes.  
5. **Software traceability**. Requirements must trace to tests and verification artifacts.  
6. **Effectivity**. `msn`, `cfg`, `lopa` present and consistent across sidecars.  
7. **Checksums**. SHA-256 for binaries and reports recorded in sidecars.  
8. **CI pass**. `ci/validate_ata15.sh` must exit 0 before merge.

## Approvals & governance
Owner role: `Flight Deck Systems` or `Crew Interface Engineering`.  
Review board: `Airworthiness`, `Human Factors`, `Flight Operations`, `Materials & Process` (if hardware changes).  
Required approvals: at least one Airworthiness and one Human Factors approval for changes affecting crew displays, alerts or procedures. Record approvals in sidecar with reviewer ID and ISO8601 timestamp.

## Sidecar minimum fields
- `id` (UUID)  
- `artifact_path`  
- `artifact_sha256`  
- `schema_id` / `schema_version`  
- `effectivity: { msn, cfg, lopa }`  
- `regulatory_refs: []`  
- `numeric_checks` (luminance, latency, SPL, etc.)  
- `hfe_summary_ref` (HFE report id)  
- `approvals: [{role, reviewer_id, timestamp, comment}]`  
- `audit_log: [{event, actor, timestamp, detail}]`

## PR checklist for Aircrew Information changes
- [ ] Sidecars present for all changed artifacts.  
- [ ] HFE evidence attached or engineering disposition provided.  
- [ ] Numeric thresholds verified against `DATA_*.csv`.  
- [ ] Software verification evidence attached for avionics/UI code.  
- [ ] SOPs updated if procedures or crew actions changed.  
- [ ] Effectivity recorded (MSN, cfg, LOPA).  
- [ ] CI (`ci/validate_ata15.sh`) green.  
- [ ] Required approvals recorded in sidecars and PR.

## Security & data handling
- Record only SHA-256 for artifact integrity. Avoid storing secrets or PII in sidecars.  
- External artifacts must be HTTPS and require authentication.  
- Sidecars and artifacts inherit repository ACLs.

## Notes
- Keep numeric thresholds in `DATA_*.csv`. Do not hardcode limits in CI tools.  
- When display or alert changes affect cabin crew or passengers (e.g., cabin call, safety brief), cross-reference [ATA 44](../ATA_44-CABIN_SYSTEMS_INCL_IFE_IFX/) and [ATA 25](../ATA_25-EQUIPMENT_FURNISHINGS/) artifacts and include cabin impact analysis.

## Contact
Owner: `Flight Deck Systems` / `Crew Interface Engineering`. For certification-impact questions escalate to `Airworthiness` and `Human Factors`.
