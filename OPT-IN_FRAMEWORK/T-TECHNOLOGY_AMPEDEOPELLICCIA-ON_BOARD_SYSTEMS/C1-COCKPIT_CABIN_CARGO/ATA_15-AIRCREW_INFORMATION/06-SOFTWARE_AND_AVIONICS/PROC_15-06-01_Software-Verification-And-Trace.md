# PROC_15-06-01 — Software Verification and Trace
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective date:** 2025-10-30  
**Owner:** Aircrew Systems Engineering / Avionics SW Verification  
**Skill level:** Senior SWV Engineer / Avionics Test Lead  
**Estimated duration:** Program dependent (planning → closure)

---

## 1.0 Purpose
Define verification, validation and traceability processes for software that supports aircrew information, displays, annunciators and associated avionics in ATA-15. Ensure DO-178C/DO-254 compliance where applicable and maintain end-to-end traceability from requirements to delivered evidence.

---

## 2.0 Scope
Applies to all software and firmware used for aircrew information and avionics features covered by ATA-15 including display drivers, alerting logic, integrated HMI controllers, and avionics middleware. Includes SW toolchains, qualification of tools, software configuration management, test artifacts and DPP linkage. Does not replace system SW design documents. Where hardware is safety-critical, coordinate with DO-254 processes.

- DO-178C — Software considerations for airborne systems  
- DO-254 — Design assurance for airborne electronic hardware (as applicable)  
- ARP4754A / ARP4761 — System development and safety assessment  
- ARINC 661 — Cockpit display integration  
- RTCA DO-160 — Environmental qualification

## 4.0 Definitions
- **SRS:** Software Requirements Specification.  
- **SRM:** Software Requirements to Module trace matrix.  
- **V&V:** Verification and Validation.  
- **SVP:** Software Verification Plan.  
- **SC:** Software Configuration.  
- **TOOLQ:** Tool Qualification per DO-178C.  
- **DPP:** Digital Product Passport.

---

## 5.0 Roles & Responsibilities
- **SW Verification Lead:** owns SVP, manages verification execution and closure.  
- **SW Developer:** delivers code, unit tests, builds and evidence.  
- **Systems/Requirements Owner:** approves SRS, change requests and effectivity.  
- **Airworthiness:** reviews final verification closure and signs cert evidence.  
- **Tool Custodian:** maintains toolchain and records tool qualification or rationale.

---

## 6.0 Verification Planning
1. Produce a **Software Verification Plan (SVP)** referencing DO-178C objectives and traceability rules. Include toolchain, environments (unit bench, HIL, simulator), entry/exit criteria, pass/fail thresholds and required artifacts.  
2. Maintain a **SW Configuration Index** listing baselines, SW IDs, compiler/linker versions and hashes. Record in DPP.  
3. Define **qualification strategy** for tools used for verification (compiler, static analyzers, coverage tools). Document TOOLQ or rationale for no-qualification.

---

## 7.0 Requirements Traceability
1. Maintain traceability matrix: **Requirement → Design → Module → Unit Test → Integration Test → System Test → HIL → Acceptance**.  
2. Each requirement line must reference: SRS ID, author, priority, verification method, and final test artifact hash (sha256).  
3. Use automated RTM tooling where possible. Reports must export to archives with checksums.

---

## 8.0 Verification Activities & Artifacts

### 8.1 Static Verification
- **Code reviews** with checklist. Record reviewer, findings, and closure.  
- **Static analysis** for MISRA/SEI/CWE rules as required. Produce tool report, rule set, tool version and hash. Tool qualification required per DO-178C if used for certification objectives.

### 8.2 Unit Testing
- Unit tests to exercise each module. Target **statement/MC/DC coverage** as required by system DAL. Attach test vectors, test harness, logs and coverage reports with hashes.

### 8.3 Integration & Module Testing
- Integration tests for subsystems (display stack, alerting, middleware). Include timing, latency and concurrency checks. Record environment and test vectors.

### 8.4 System & HIL Testing
- System tests in representative avionics environment. HIL to mimic sensors, busses and failure modes. Document configuration, stimuli, expected responses, and raw logs.

### 8.5 Regression & Release Testing
- Regression suite for every build. Define acceptance criteria. Maintain automated CI with artifact signing and traceable build IDs.

### 8.6 Performance & Stress Testing
- Verify latencies (event-to-alert), frame rates, throughput, memory usage and fault handling under stress. Document thresholds and margin.

### 8.7 Security & Robustness Tests
- Fuzzing for parsing inputs, boundary tests, authentication and integrity of update mechanism. Document vulnerabilities and mitigations.

---

## 9.0 Coverage & Metrics
- Define coverage targets per DAL: statement/decision/MC/DC.  
- Provide coverage reports per module and per build. Any reduction below thresholds requires disposition.

---

## 10.0 Toolchain & Build Integrity
- Use reproducible builds where possible. Record compiler/linker versions, build scripts and environment.  
- Sign build artifacts and store SHA-256 hashes in DPP.  
- Tool qualification per DO-178C when tools eliminate verification objectives or automate evidence generation.

---

## 11.0 Anomaly Management
- Log each verification anomaly with severity, reproduction steps and disposition. Close anomalies before verification closure unless accepted by Airworthiness with risk mitigation.

---

## 12.0 Software Change & Regression Control
- Every change follows CR process. Re-run impacted tests and coverage. Update traceability matrix. For changes to safety-critical behavior require revalidation and Airworthiness approval.

---

## 13.0 Verification Closure & Reporting
- Produce **Software Verification Closure Report** containing: traceability matrix status, coverage evidence, test reports, tool qualification statements, anomaly log and approval stamps. Include DPP entries and artifact hashes. Airworthiness signs closure.

---

## 14.0 DO-178C Mapping (example)
- SVP maps to DO-178C objectives. Provide a table linking each DO-178C objective to local artifact (SRS, design, code, test report, coverage). Store table in `DATA_15-06-DO178C-MAP.csv`.

---

## 15.0 Traceability to DPP
- For each SW baseline produce DPP record with SW version, hash, toolchain, FAT/SV reports and certification evidence. Link releases to hardware PN/SN where applicable.

---

## 16.0 Security & SW Update
- Secure SW load and rollback. Use cryptographic verification for SW images. Record SW baseline hash in sidecar and DPP. Document rollback rationale and steps.

---

## 17.0 Records & Retention
- Retain SW verification artifacts per program policy. Raw logs and instrument outputs: 24 months. Final closure packages and DPP entries: indefinite (or per regulatory requirement). Include sha256 for all binary/log artifacts.

---

## 18.0 Safety Warnings
- Do not finalize verification closure if any DO-178C objective marked incomplete without explicit Airworthiness disposition.  
- Tools that alter code generation must be qualified or their output treated as untrusted until verified.
