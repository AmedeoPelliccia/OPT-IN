# PROC_15-03-01 — Audio Alert Design and Test
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective date:** 2025-10-30  
**Owner:** Aircrew Systems Engineering  
**Skill level:** Intermediate  
**Estimated duration:** 4–8 hours (design cycle)  
**Personnel required:** 2 (Human Factors and Avionics Test)

---

## 1.0 Purpose
Specify design rules and test methods for cockpit and cabin audio alerts. Ensure alerts are unambiguous, distinguishable, auditable, and meet human-factors and regulatory requirements. Provide stepwise test methods from unit FAT to integrated in-sim verification.

---

## 2.0 Scope
Applies to all crew and cabin audio alerts generated by avionics, cabin management, emergency and maintenance systems. Covers design attributes, signal properties, test rigs, acceptance criteria, integration tests and traceability to DPP and sidecars. Does not replace system-level SW/HW design docs.

---

## 3.0 Applicable Standards & Cross-references
- RTCA/DO-160 (Environmental / Acoustic / EMI)  
- DO-178C (safety-critical display/alert software) — where SW generates critical alerts  
- ARINC 661 / ARINC guidance for integrated alerts where applicable  
- Human-factors guidance (operator HMI standards)  
- ATA-15, ATA-20 (workmanship), ATA-51 (LSP continuity where audio harness bonding affected)

---

## 4.0 Definitions
- **Priority:** Critical (Immediate), Warning (High), Caution (Medium), Advisory (Low).  
- **SPL:** Sound Pressure Level measured in dB(A).  
- **SNR:** Signal-to-noise ratio.  
- **Tone:** Discrete frequency or chord.  
- **Speech Alert:** Recorded or synthetic speech.  
- **Masking:** Loss of alert audibility due to background noise.

---

## 5.0 Design Principles (required)
1. **Unique Identity:** Each priority-class alert must have a unique auditory signature. Do not reuse signature for different critical events.  
2. **Priority Mapping:** Map priority to perceptual features (loudness, tempo, spectral content):  
   - Critical: high urgency, high SPL, short repetitive bursts or distinctive chord.  
   - Warning: prominent but lower than Critical.  
   - Caution: noticeable tonal sequence.  
   - Advisory: short, low-level tone or chime.  
3. **SNR Target:** Ensure SNR ≥ 15 dB(A) at nominal cockpit noise for Critical alerts and ≥ 10 dB(A) for Warning/Caution.  
4. **Duration & Repetition:** Keep message duration and repetition consistent and minimal. Provide escape or acknowledge controls where applicable.  
5. **Frequency Content:** Use frequency bands with high human sensitivity (500–3000 Hz) and avoid bands easily masked by typical cockpit noise (low-frequency engine harmonics).  
6. **Non-confusion:** Avoid melodic or linguistic similarity with commercial signals or cabin announcements. Speech messages must be unambiguous and short.  
7. **Localization:** Allow left/right/center rendering only for diagnostic or directional cues; critical alerts should remain mono-located at a defined center reference.  
8. **Accessibility:** Speech alerts shall have optional text equivalents on displays. Consider hearing-impaired crew workflows in maintenance procedures.  
9. **Robustness:** Alerts must survive EMC, thermal and vibration conditions per DO-160. Self-test and BIT required.

## 6.0 Signal & Performance Parameters (design table)

| Parameter | Critical | Warning | Caution | Advisory | Units / Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Target SPL @ ear (nominal) | 85–95 | 78–86 | 72–78 | 65–72 | dB(A) at 1 m or ear position; see measurement method |
| Max SPL (short peak) | 110 | 105 | 100 | 95 | dB(A) — protect hearing |
| SNR target | ≥15 | ≥12 | ≥10 | ≥8 | dB(A) above ambient baseline |
| Frequency band | 500–3k | 400–2.5k | 400–2k | 300–2k | Apparent tonality in band |
| Pulse rate / pattern | 1.5 Hz bursts or unique pattern | 1.0–1.5 Hz | 0.5–1.0 Hz | single chime | Hz or pattern description |
| Duty cycle | 40–60% | 30–50% | 20–40% | 10–30% | % |
| Duration | 0.5–3 s repeated | 0.5–4 s | 0.3–3 s | 0.2–1 s | per repetition |
| Harmonic richness | Rich (chord) | Medium | Simple tone | Simple chime | avoid pure sine for Critical |

## 7.0 Safety & Ergonomics Constraints
- Do not exceed hearing-protective thresholds. Long exposure > 85 dB(A) requires mitigation.  
- Critical alerts must not impede comprehension of other simultaneous speech alerts. Prioritize with gating/ducking rules.  
- Provide manual acknowledge and suppression policies. Suppression must be logged and reversible.  
- Design to avoid startle that could induce unsafe control inputs.

---

## 8.0 Test Strategy Overview
Tests proceed from unit FAT → bench integration → aircraft integration → simulator/HIL → operational field trial.

### 8.1 Unit FAT (Factory Acceptance Test)
- Verify frequency content, SPL, SNR, pattern, duty cycle and harmonics.  
- Use calibrated measurement microphone at defined ear reference and 1 m; log raw .wav and measurement CSV. Include instrument calibration ID.  
- Test under temperature extremes per DO-160 subset for audio devices.

### 8.2 Integration Bench Test
- Verify audio chain: DSP, codec, amplifiers, speaker/load, connectors, harness EMI.  
- Confirm LSP continuity and bonding if audio harness passes LSP zones.  
- Verify SW-controlled alert generation and timing (latency ≤ 100 ms from event to audio onset for Critical).

### 8.3 Cabin/Flightdeck Acoustic Test
- Install device in representative cockpit mockup. Generate representative ambient noise (engine/vent/airflow) at nominal cruise and taxi levels.  
- Measure SPL at crew ear positions (left, right, center) and compute SNR. Test all priority classes.  
- Verify intelligibility for speech alerts by STI or SII metric; target STI ≥ 0.6 for critical speech.

### 8.4 HIL / Simulator Test
- Validate integration with system events, annunciator light pairing, and automated suppression/ducking.  
- Validate operator reaction time in simulated events for critical alerts.

### 8.5 Operational Field Trial
- Monitor alert effectiveness and nuisance rates. Record crew feedback and adjust thresholds if safety-equivalent improvements documented.

## 9.0 Measurement Methods & Instrumentation
- Microphone: Class 1, free-field-corrected, calibrated within certificate date. Record calibration ID.  
- Measurement positions: pilot left ear (head centroid), pilot right ear, cockpit center ear. Specify height and head-neck model.  
- Ambient noise reference: measure A-weighted spectrum and report 1/3-octave bands. Use same test rig for repeatability.  
- File formats: raw audio `.wav` 48 kHz/24-bit plus measurement `.csv` with timestamped SPL and spectrogram. Hash raw files (sha256) and attach to report.

---

## 10.0 Acceptance Criteria (tests)
- **Unit FAT:** All signal parameters within spec.  
- **Integration Bench:** LATENCY ≤ 100 ms; no clipping; distortion THD ≤ 1% at test level.  
- **Cabin Test:** SPL within target ±3 dB; SNR meets class target; STI ≥ 0.6 for speech-critical alerts.  
- **HIL/Sim:** No false-positive suppression; correct priority handling; acknowledge path verified.  
- **Safety:** No alert produces SPL > allowed max peaks. Any exceedance requires engineering mitigation.

---

## 11.0 Test Procedure (step-by-step) — Cabin Acoustic Test (example)
1. Prepare cockpit mock-up. Place calibrated microphones at crew ear reference points. Document instrument calibration IDs.  
2. Configure ambient noise playback: taxi, takeoff, cruise spectra at representative levels. Log ambient spectrum.  
3. Play each alert signature sequentially and record three repetitions. Log timestamps, SPL and spectrogram.  
4. Calculate SNR per alert as Alert_Signal_RMS − Ambient_RMS in dB(A).  
5. For speech alerts compute STI and verify intelligibility.  
6. Record pass/fail per acceptance table. Attach raw files and sha256 checksums.  
7. If fail, document corrective action, retest after change.

---

## 12.0 Troubleshooting & Common Failures
- **Low SPL / low SNR:** Check amplifier gain, speaker wiring, speaker impedance, acoustic coupling, or masking ambient noise.  
- **Clipping / distortion:** Reduce drive level, check amplifier rails, verify DSP headroom.  
- **Latency >100 ms:** Check buffering, networked audio paths, codec settings and SW scheduling.  
- **Speech unintelligible:** Check compression, bandwidth, STI, or background noise masking. Consider alternate wording.

---

## 13.0 Documentation & Traceability
- For each alert produce: design spec, raw audio `.wav`, measurement CSV, report JSON, instrument calibration cert, test operator, DPP entry.  
- Attach raw-file `sha256` in the test report and procedure sidecar.  
- Update DPP for devices providing SW baseline hash and FAT report hash.

---

## 14.0 Maintenance & Field Revalidation
- Re-validate critical alerts after SW update, amplifier replacement, speaker swap, or any structural change to console affecting acoustic coupling.  
- Periodic check interval: annual cabin acoustic verification; or after 500 FH if specified by operator. Document interval in `DATA_15-03-xx_Inspection-Intervals-And-Acceptance.csv`.

---

## 15.0 Safety Warnings
- Do not perform high-SPL tests without hearing protection for personnel. Post warning signage and limit exposure time.  
- Ensure test ambient does not mask real system alerts in integrated avionics. Use isolated test mode where possible.
