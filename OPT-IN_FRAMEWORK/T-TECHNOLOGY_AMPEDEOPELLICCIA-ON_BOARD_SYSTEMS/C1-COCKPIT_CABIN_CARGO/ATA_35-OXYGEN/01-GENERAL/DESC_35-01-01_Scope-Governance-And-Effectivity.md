### Airworthiness Limitations

The following items are designated as Airworthiness Limitation Items (ALI) per ATA-04 and are non-deferrable:

- Oxygen cylinder hydrostatic test intervals (typically 60 months)
- Cylinder neck and valve NDT inspections (per life cycle or after damage)
- Regulator functional test intervals (12 months)
- Mask deployment system functional tests (24 months)
- Oxygen purity verification at refill (≥99.5% O₂)
- Pressure relief valve functional tests (12 months)

### Limits and Tolerances

All numeric limits, tolerances, and acceptance criteria defined in this chapter are **mandatory limits** and cannot be exceeded without:
1. Engineering disposition and analysis
2. Airworthiness approval
3. Safety assessment
4. Documentation in Digital Product Passport (ATA-95)

This includes but is not limited to:
- Cylinder service and test pressures
- Regulator setpoints and tolerances
- Leak rate acceptance criteria
- Oxygen purity thresholds
- Corrosion and damage limits
- Inspection intervals
- Deployment time limits

## Effectivity

### Aircraft Applicability

**Manufacturer Serial Numbers (MSN):** ALL AMPEL360 aircraft  
**Configuration:** ALL configurations with crew and/or passenger oxygen systems

### System Variants

This chapter addresses the following oxygen system configurations:

1. **Gaseous Oxygen (GOX) Systems:**
   - Central storage cylinders with distribution manifold
   - Individual cylinders at service locations
   - High-pressure (150-200 bar typical) oxygen storage
   - Regulators for crew and passenger supply

2. **Chemical Oxygen Generator Systems:**
   - Passenger service unit (PSU) mounted generators
   - Automatic deployment with mask drop
   - Time-limited oxygen supply (typically 12-22 minutes)
   - Thermal management and safety considerations

3. **Portable Oxygen Equipment:**
   - Walk-around bottles for flight attendants
   - Therapeutic oxygen for medical use
   - Portable protective breathing equipment (PBE)

4. **Hybrid Systems:**
   - Combination of GOX for crew and chemical generators for passengers
   - Central GOX with portable backup

### Retrofit and Modification Applicability

All retrofits, modifications, and service bulletins affecting oxygen systems must:
1. Reference this chapter for baseline requirements
2. Update effectivity tables in affected sections
3. Obtain engineering approval for any changes to limits or procedures
4. Document changes in Digital Product Passport (ATA-95)

## Cross-Chapter Dependencies

This chapter has dependencies on and provides inputs to:

- **ATA-04:** Airworthiness Limitations (inspection intervals, life limits)
- **ATA-05:** Time Limits & Maintenance Checks (scheduled inspections)
- **ATA-20:** Standard Practices - Airframe (torque, fasteners, sealants)
- **ATA-21:** Air Conditioning & Pressurization (cabin altitude monitoring, deployment triggers)
- **ATA-24:** Electrical Power (sensor power, deployment solenoid power, indications)
- **ATA-25:** Equipment/Furnishings (mask stowage, PSU integration, crew stations)
- **ATA-26:** Fire Protection (oxygen storage area fire detection and suppression)

## Document Control

### Revision Control

All documents in this chapter follow the revision control scheme:
- **Major.Minor.Patch** (e.g., 1.0.0)
- Major: Significant changes affecting procedures or limits
- Minor: Clarifications, additions, or non-critical updates
- Patch: Editorial corrections

### Approval Process

Documents in this chapter require approval from:
1. Document Author
