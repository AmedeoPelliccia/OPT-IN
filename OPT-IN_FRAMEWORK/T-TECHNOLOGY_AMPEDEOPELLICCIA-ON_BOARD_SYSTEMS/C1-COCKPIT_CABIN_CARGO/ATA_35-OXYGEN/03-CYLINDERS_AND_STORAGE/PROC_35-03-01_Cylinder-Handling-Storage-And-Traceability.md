# PROC_35-03-01 — Cylinder Handling, Storage and Traceability

**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective date:** 2025-10-30  
**Owner:** Cabin Systems / Oxygen

## Purpose

Safe handling, storage, transport and traceability for oxygen cylinders used in AMPEL360 aircraft. This procedure ensures all cylinders are properly identified, inspected, stored, and tracked throughout their service life.

## Safety

**CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING:** Oxygen-enriched environment hazard. High-pressure gas hazard. Fire and explosion risk.

- No oil, grease, or hydrocarbon contamination allowed on cylinders, valves, or fittings.
- Use only oxygen-safe PPE (clean, oil-free gloves and tools).
- No smoking, open flames, or spark-producing activities within 25 feet of oxygen cylinders.
- Personnel must be trained in oxygen handling and emergency procedures.
- Ensure adequate ventilation in storage and handling areas.

## Prerequisites

- Cylinder Certificate of Conformance (CoC) available
- Calibration/hydrostatic test certificates available
- Personnel qualified in oxygen cylinder handling (training: OXY-SVC-L2)
- Oxygen-safe tools and equipment (clean, non-sparking)

## Procedure

### 1. Cylinder Receipt and Identification

1.1. Verify cylinder serial number matches CoC documentation.

1.2. Record the following information:
   - Cylinder serial number
   - Part number
   - Manufacturer
   - Manufacturing date
   - Last hydrostatic test date
   - Next hydrostatic test due date
   - CoC number
   - Lot number (if applicable)

1.3. Verify all required markings are legible:
   - Service pressure (bar or psi)
   - Test pressure
   - Manufacturer identification
   - DOT or ISO specification number
   - Serial number

### 2. Initial Visual Inspection

2.1. Inspect cylinder exterior for:
   - Dents, gouges, or mechanical damage
   - Corrosion (pitting, surface rust, discoloration)
   - Neck and valve thread condition
   - Label and marking legibility
   - Physical damage to valve or fitting

2.2. Acceptance criteria:
   - No dents exceeding 5 mm depth or 25 mm diameter
   - No corrosion pits exceeding 0.5 mm depth
   - No cracks or visible damage to cylinder neck
   - Valve threads clean and undamaged
   - All markings legible

2.3. Photograph any anomalies and record in inspection log.

2.4. If damage exceeds acceptance criteria, quarantine cylinder and notify Engineering.

### 3. Service Pressure Verification

3.1. Using a calibrated pressure gauge, verify cylinder service pressure is within specification:
   - Typical service pressure: 150-200 bar (2,175-2,900 psi)
   - Verify pressure matches manufacturer specification on cylinder label

3.2. Check valve condition:
   - Verify valve operates smoothly (if applicable)
   - Check for leaks at valve stem and body
   - Verify safety relief valve is present and not damaged

### 4. Storage Conditions

4.1. Store cylinders in designated oxygen storage area:
   - Vertical orientation, secured with chains or straps
   - Valve protection cap installed
   - Separated from flammable materials by minimum 20 feet or fire-rated barrier
   - Protected from direct sunlight and extreme temperatures

4.2. Environmental requirements:
   - Temperature range: -20°C to +50°C (-4°F to +122°F)
   - Relative humidity: <60%
   - Adequate ventilation (minimum 6 air changes per hour)

4.3. Secure cylinders to prevent tipping or impact damage.

4.4. Mark storage location with "OXYGEN - NO SMOKING - NO OPEN FLAMES" signage.

### 5. Hydrostatic Test Interval Tracking

5.1. Verify next hydrostatic test due date from CoC or cylinder markings.

5.2. Record in cylinder tracking system:
   - Last hydrostatic test date
   - Next hydrostatic test due date (typically 60 months from last test)
   - Alert date for test scheduling (6 months prior to due date)

5.3. Mark cylinder with color-coded tag indicating test status:
   - Green: Current, >12 months until due
   - Yellow: Approaching due, 6-12 months until due
   - Red: Due or overdue, <6 months until due or past due

5.4. Remove from service any cylinder past hydrostatic test due date.

### 6. Transfer and Packaging for Refill/Transport

6.1. Verify cylinder is secured for transport:
   - Valve protection cap installed
   - Cylinder secured to prevent movement
   - DOT or international transport regulations followed

6.2. Complete transport documentation:
   - Cylinder serial number
   - Service pressure
   - Last inspection date
   - Destination and purpose

6.3. Ensure transport vehicle is suitable for compressed gas cylinders:
   - Adequate ventilation
   - Secured mounting points
   - Fire extinguisher available
   - No smoking or ignition sources

## Documentation

Complete Cylinder Handling and Storage Log with the following information:
- Date and time of handling/inspection
- Cylinder serial number
- CoC reference number
- Last hydrostatic test date
- Next hydrostatic test due date
- Visual inspection results
- Service pressure reading
- Storage location assigned
- Inspector name and signature
- Any anomalies or special notes
