### Dynamic Requirements (14 CFR 25.562)
- Passenger seats must pass dynamic tests:
  - **Forward-facing**: 16g forward, change in velocity 44 ft/s (13.4 m/s)
  - **Aft-facing**: 14g rearward
  - **Combined loading**: Forward with yaw component
- **HIC Limits**: HIC₁₅ ≤ 1000, HIC₃₆ ≤ 1000
- **Chest acceleration**: ≤ 60g
- **Femur load**: ≤ 10,000 N per leg
- **Lumbar load**: ≤ 6,672 N
- **Shoulder belt load**: ≤ 16,000 N (on a shoulder)

### Restraint Requirements (14 CFR 25.785)
- Lap belts must be provided for each passenger and crew seat
- Shoulder harnesses required for:
  - All crew seats
  - Passenger seats in aircraft with more than 44 seats (unless certain exceptions apply)
- Belt design:
  - Minimum lap belt width: 2 inches (50.8 mm)
  - Minimum shoulder belt width: 2 inches (50.8 mm)
  - Quick-release buckle with single action
  - Color-coded or clearly marked for proper use

### Seat Rail Interface
- Seat rails must comply with industry standards (typically SAE AS8049)
- Seat track pitch: Typically 1 inch (25.4 mm)
- Attachment fittings must provide positive locking
- Torque specifications per manufacturer and M&P standards

## Flammability Requirements (14 CFR 25.853)

- No flaming drips

### Seat Structure Materials
- Composite structures must meet flammability requirements
- Metal structures generally exempt but protective coatings must comply

## Applicable Standards

### Primary Standards
- **14 CFR Part 25.561**: Emergency landing conditions (static)
- **14 CFR Part 25.562**: Emergency landing dynamic conditions
- **14 CFR Part 25.785**: Seats, berths, safety belts, and harnesses
- **14 CFR Part 25.853**: Compartment interiors (flammability)
- **CS-25**: EASA equivalent standards

### Industry Standards
- **SAE AS8049 Rev C**: Performance Standard for Seats in Civil Rotorcraft, Transport Aircraft, and General Aviation Aircraft
- **SAE ARP5526**: Flammability Test Procedures for Aircraft Seat Cushions
- **ISO 6487**: Road vehicles — Measurement techniques in impact tests — Instrumentation

### Test Standards

## Qualification and Testing

### Type Qualification
Every seat model must complete:
1. Static strength tests (per 14 CFR 25.561)
2. Dynamic impact tests (per 14 CFR 25.562)
3. Flammability tests (per 14 CFR 25.853)
4. Functional endurance tests (wear, recline, tray table)

### Production Acceptance
Each production seat requires:
- Dimensional inspection
- Functional test (recline, tray table, restraint)
- Visual inspection (finish, upholstery)
- Torque verification at installation

## Installation Requirements

### Seat Track Attachment
- Seats attach to floor-mounted seat tracks
- Seat fittings must engage a minimum number of track clips (typically 4 per leg)
- Torque values specified in `DATA_25-02-04_Seat-Rail-Torque-And-Limits.csv`

### Bonding and Grounding
- Electrical bonding between seat and structure
- Bonding resistance ≤ 2.5 mΩ
- Test with 100A DC bonding tester

### Interfaces
- **Electrical**: Power outlets (110V AC, USB, 12V DC)
- **IFE**: Video and data connections
- **Pneumatic**: Air supply for lumbar support (if applicable)

## Maintenance and Inspection

### Scheduled Inspections
- **GVI (General Visual Inspection)**: Every A-check (typically 500-750 FH)
- **DVI (Detailed Visual Inspection)**: Every C-check (typically 3000-4500 FH)
- **Functional Test**: Recline, tray table, restraint operation

### Common Discrepancies
- Seat rail attachment loose or corroded
- Restraint belt frayed or damaged
- Tray table hinge worn or binding
- Cushion sagging or torn
- IFE screen inoperative
- Recline mechanism binding
