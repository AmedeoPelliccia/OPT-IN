- [CS-25](https://www.easa.europa.eu/en/document-library/certification-specifications/cs-25-large-aeroplanes) — EASA equivalent standards

## Mandatory items
- **Regulations**: Capture all applicable CS/14 CFR Part 25 clauses for the artifact.
- **Evidence**: Dynamic test results (25.562), flammability reports (25.853), material Certificates of Conformity, torque logs, bonding/grounding records.
- **Effectivity**: Record MSN, cabin configuration and LOPA version for every artifact.
- **Numerics**: Seat rail torques, allowable free-play, restraint inspection limits, bin deflection and attach loads, bonding resistance limits.
- **Traceability**: Sidecars with approvals, SHA-256 checksums for test artifacts, drawing references and LOPA IDs.

## Quick operational notes
- **Validate** artifacts against schemas in `schemas/`.
- **Compute** SHA-256 for every binary and text artifact. Store in sidecar.
- **Effectivity** fields (msn, cfg, lopa) are mandatory for records that claim certification or test coverage.
- **Numeric checks** must reference corresponding CSVs (e.g., `DATA_25-02-04_Seat-Rail-Torque-And-Limits.csv`).
- **CI**: `ci/validate_ata25.sh` should be run by maintainers and CI for every PR touching ATA 25 paths. The PR must pass CI before merging.

## Governance
Owner role: `Cabin Interiors Engineering`.
Review board: `Airworthiness`, `Human Factors`, `Materials & Process`, `Structures`.
Required approvals: at least one Airworthiness plus one Materials & Process approval for material/flammability changes. Record approvals in sidecar with ISO8601 timestamps and reviewer IDs.

## Sidecars & traceability
- Sidecars live in `11-SIDE-CAR_META/` or adjacent to artifacts.
- Sidecar must include: artifact SHA-256, schema id/version, effectivity, regulatory refs, numeric checks, approvals and an audit log.
- Keep numeric thresholds in `DATA_*.csv` files. Do not hardcode numeric limits in code.

## Contribution & PR checklist
When opening a PR that modifies ATA 25:
1. Add or update sidecars for every changed artifact.
2. Include SHA-256 fingerprints for attached artifacts.
3. Attach required evidence for any regulatory claim.
4. Run `ci/validate_ata25.sh` locally or rely on CI.
5. In PR description include effectivity (msn, cfg, lopa) and LOPA version.
6. Request reviewers from the review board. Ensure required approvals are recorded before merge.

## Notes
- The ATA 21 link uses the directory `ATA_21-ECS_INTERFACES`. Adjust if your ATA-21 folder differs.
- `INDEX.meta.yaml` contains chapter metadata and ATA traceability. Harmonize URLs across files if you rename chapters or move directories.

## Contact
Owner: `Cabin Interiors Engineering`. For governance questions open an issue or tag the owner in the PR.
