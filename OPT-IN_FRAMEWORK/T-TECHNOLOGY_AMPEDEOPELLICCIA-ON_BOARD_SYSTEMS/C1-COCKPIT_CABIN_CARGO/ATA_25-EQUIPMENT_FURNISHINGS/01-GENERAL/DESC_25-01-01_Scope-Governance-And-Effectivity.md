## Governance

### Owner Role
**Cabin Interiors Engineering** is the designated owner for ATA 25.

### Review Board
All ATA 25 artifacts require review and approval from:
- **Airworthiness Engineering**: Ensures regulatory compliance
- **Human Factors**: Validates accessibility, ergonomics, and safety
- **Materials & Process (M&P)**: Certifies material compliance and flammability
- **Structures**: Reviews load paths and attachment integrity

### Required Approvals
For material or flammability changes:
- Minimum one approval from **Airworthiness Engineering**
- Minimum one approval from **Materials & Process**

All approvals must be recorded in the artifact sidecar with:
- Approver name and role
- ISO8601 timestamp
- Reviewer ID or certification number

## Effectivity

### Manufacturer Serial Number (MSN)
All artifacts must specify effectivity by MSN:
- Use specific MSN ranges (e.g., "MSN 001-050")
- Use "ALL" for universal applicability
- Use "TBD" only during initial development

### Configuration
Document the aircraft configuration identifier:
- Standard configuration ID format
- Reference to configuration control documentation

### LOPA Version
Layout of Passenger Accommodations (LOPA) must be specified:
- LOPA version number (e.g., "LOPA-A350-2.1")
- LOPA effective date
- Reference to LOPA drawing or documentation

### Cabin Zones
Document applicable cabin zones:
- First Class / Business / Premium Economy / Economy
- Zone designations (e.g., Zone A, B, C)
- Row ranges
