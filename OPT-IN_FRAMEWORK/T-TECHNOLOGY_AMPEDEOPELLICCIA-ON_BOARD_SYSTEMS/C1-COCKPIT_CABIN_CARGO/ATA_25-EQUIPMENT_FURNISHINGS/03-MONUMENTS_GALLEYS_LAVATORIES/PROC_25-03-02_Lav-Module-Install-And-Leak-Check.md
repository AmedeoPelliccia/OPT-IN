## Purpose
Installation procedure for lavatory monuments including leak testing of water and waste systems.

## Safety
- Electrical hazard: De-energize lavatory power
- Water/waste exposure: Wear gloves and eye protection
- Heavy lift: Lavatory modules can weigh 150-400 kg

## Procedure Summary
1. Position lavatory module using lifting equipment
2. Install structural attach fasteners
3. Verify bonding resistance ≤ 2.5 mΩ
4. Connect water supply lines
5. Connect waste drain lines
6. Connect electrical services
7. **Leak Test (30 minutes at operating pressure)**:
   - Water system: Pressurize to 3.5 bar (50 psi)
   - Waste system: Fill to operating level
   - Inspect all connections for leaks
8. Functional test: flush, faucet, soap dispenser, lights
9. Complete installation record

## Acceptance Criteria
- No leaks during 30-minute pressure test
- All electrical equipment functional
- Door and lock operate smoothly
- Bonding resistance ≤ 2.5 mΩ
