# PROC 25-03-01 — Galley Install, Bonding, and Services

## Purpose
Procedure for installation of galley monuments including structural attachment, bonding/grounding, and connection of electrical, water, and waste services.

## Safety
- **Electrical hazard**: De-energize galley power circuits before installation
- **Water/waste leak**: Ensure proper sealing and leak testing
- **Heavy lift**: Galley monuments can weigh 200-500 kg
- **Pinch points**: Between monument and structure during positioning

## Prerequisites
- Galley monument part number verified per LOPA
- Structural attach points inspected and serviceable
- Electrical, water, and waste services available and isolated
- Lifting equipment (hoist, straps) available and rated for load

## Procedure Summary
1. Verify effectivity and LOPA
2. Position galley monument using hoist
3. Align attach points and install fasteners hand-tight
4. Torque all fasteners per `DATA_25-03-03_Monument-Attach-And-Load-Paths.csv`
5. Verify bonding resistance ≤ 2.5 mΩ
6. Connect electrical services (110V AC, 208V AC, control circuits)
7. Connect water supply and drain lines
8. Connect waste drain lines
9. Perform leak test (water and waste systems)
10. Perform electrical functional test (power, lights, ovens, chillers)
11. Install covers and panels
12. Complete installation record

## Acceptance Criteria
- All fasteners torqued within tolerance
- Bonding resistance ≤ 2.5 mΩ
- No water or waste leaks during 30-minute pressure test
- All electrical equipment functional
- Galley aligned per LOPA datum
