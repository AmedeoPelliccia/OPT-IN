## Governance & Owners
- **Governance owner**: Cabin Systems Engineering  
- **Review board**: [Cabin Systems, Airworthiness, Human Factors, Materials & Process, Safety Engineering]
- **Approval authorities**: Airworthiness Engineering (for safety-critical changes), Quality Assurance (for production release)

## Effectivity
Default: AMPEL360 baseline (MSN: ALL, CONFIG: ALL). Specific effectivity by MSN, production block, configuration variant, or modification must be recorded in `INDEX.meta.yaml` and per-document sidecars.

## Mandatory chapter conventions
- All documents MUST include a `.meta.yaml` sidecar following the OPT-IN template in `15-SIDE-CAR_META/templates`.
- Use ISO 8601 dates (`YYYY-MM-DD`) in sidecars and records.
- All artwork files (SVG, PDF, PNG) must include SHA-256 file hash in sidecar metadata.
- Numeric legibility criteria are MANDATORY: minimum font size (mm or px@distance), minimum contrast ratio, stroke width (mm), viewing distance (m).
- CSV data files MUST include units in column headers (e.g., `Font_Size_mm`, `Contrast_Ratio_unitless`, `Viewing_Distance_m`).
- Materials specifications must reference approved supplier part numbers and require Certificate of Conformance (CofC).
- Any change to safety-critical wording or symbols REQUIRES Airworthiness approval and safety assessment reference in sidecar.
- Languages/localization fields required for all safety-critical text: primary language, translations, translation approval authority, translation date.

## High-priority technical topics (must be explicit)

### 1. Legibility and Human Factors
- Minimum font sizes by viewing distance and lighting conditions (day, night, emergency)
- Contrast ratios: minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 7:1 for safety-critical text
- Stroke width requirements for engraved or etched markings
- Character height, width, spacing specifications
- Reflectance and luminance values for retroreflective and photoluminescent placards
- Color specifications (Pantone, RAL, or CIE coordinates) with tolerance bands
- Readability test protocols: viewing angle, ambient lighting, observer distance

### 2. Materials and M&P
- Substrate materials: aluminum alloy specs (AMS), acrylic (BMS), polycarbonate (BMS), vinyl (BMS)
- Ink types: UV-resistant, solvent-based, water-based with fade resistance specifications
- Adhesive specifications: acrylic PSA (pressure-sensitive adhesive), epoxy, silicone with peel strength and shear strength values
- Surface preparation: cleaning solvents, abrasion requirements, priming procedures
- Cure requirements: time-temperature profiles, ambient conditions, pot life
- Shelf life and storage conditions: temperature range, humidity limits, UV protection
- Environmental qualification: temperature cycling (-55°C to +85°C), humidity, salt spray, UV exposure (ASTM G154), fluid resistance

### 3. Placement and Datum References
- Station/zone coordinate system: fuselage station (FS), buttock line (BL), water line (WL)
- Location tables with X, Y, Z coordinates relative to aircraft datum
- Mounting tolerance specifications: ±0.5mm for cockpit, ±1.0mm for cabin
- Installation reference drawings with callouts
- Interference checks with other components
- Accessibility for inspection and replacement

### 4. Languages and Localization
- Primary language: English (aviation standard)
- Secondary languages by region: French (Canada), Spanish (Latin America), Arabic (Middle East), Chinese (Asia-Pacific)
- Translation approval process: qualified aviation translator, technical review, airworthiness sign-off
- Symbol usage: ICAO standard symbols, ISO 3864 safety symbols
- Right-to-left language considerations (Arabic, Hebrew)
- Character encoding: UTF-8 for all text files

### 5. Temporary Placards
- Material: high-visibility adhesive vinyl or magnetic substrate
- Tagging: "TEMPORARY" marking, installation date, removal date, responsible authority
- Durability: minimum 30 days for cabin, 90 days for cargo areas
- Maximum service time limits by location and environmental exposure
- Removal procedure: complete adhesive removal, surface restoration, inspection

### 6. Inspection and Acceptance Criteria
- GVI (General Visual Inspection) intervals: 500 flight hours or 6 months
- DVI (Detailed Visual Inspection) for safety-critical placards: 1000 flight hours or 12 months
- Measurable acceptance criteria: no fading (colorimeter ΔE < 5), no cracking, no peeling (>95% adhesion), legibility maintained (contrast ratio >4.5:1)
- Remediation actions: re-lamination, replacement, adhesive re-bonding
- Inspection reporting: log entry with findings, corrective action, inspector signature

### 7. Artwork and Graphics Traceability
- File formats: vector (SVG, AI, PDF), raster (PNG minimum 300 DPI)
- Color space: CMYK for print, sRGB for displays, Pantone reference for color-critical applications
- SHA-256 hash for every artwork file version
- Effectivity tracking: MSN ranges, configuration variants, modification incorporation
- Version control: revision number, release date, approval authority
- Repository structure: organized by ATA chapter, system, and placard ID

### 8. Change Control and Safety Assessment
- Change classification: safety-critical (requires airworthiness approval), non-critical (engineering release only)
- Safety-critical triggers: wording changes to emergency instructions, symbol changes for hazard warnings, color changes affecting recognition
- Approval workflow: engineering change proposal → safety assessment → airworthiness review → production release
- Sidecar metadata requirements: change justification, safety assessment reference, approval signatures, effectivity
- Traceability to design requirements, certification basis, and regulatory compliance

## Audit and traceability
- Every placard installation or change must include: installation record with location coordinates, material CofC, cure log (for adhesives), artwork file with SHA-256 hash, effectivity statement, approvals recorded in sidecar.
- CI validators (`ci/validate_ata11.sh`) must check: sidecars present, schema conformance, CSV units, numeric legibility criteria completeness, SHA-256 hash presence for artwork, ISO date format, effectivity not in future, safety-critical change approval.
- Audit trail requirements: who (installer/approver), what (placard ID, artwork version), when (installation date, effectivity date), where (station/zone coordinates), why (modification reference, safety assessment).

## Next steps
1. Review and approve `INDEX.meta.yaml` governance structure
2. Populate all PROC, DATA, DESC files with real content (not placeholders)
3. Generate example records with sample data
4. Run `ci/validate_ata11.sh` to verify completeness
5. Integrate with production systems and artwork repositories
6. Train personnel on new procedures and validation requirements

## Notes
This chapter is flight-critical. All changes to safety-critical placards or markings require Airworthiness approval and safety assessment. Do not publish proprietary artwork or supplier confidential data without explicit authorization. Store only SHA-256 references for controlled artwork files.
