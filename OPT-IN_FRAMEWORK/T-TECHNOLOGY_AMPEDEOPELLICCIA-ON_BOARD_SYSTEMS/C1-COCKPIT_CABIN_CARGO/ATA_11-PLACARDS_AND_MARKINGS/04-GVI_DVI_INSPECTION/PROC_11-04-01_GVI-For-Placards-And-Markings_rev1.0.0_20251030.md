## 1. Scope and Purpose

### 1.1 Purpose
This procedure establishes the method for conducting General Visual Inspection (GVI) of aircraft placards and markings to verify legibility, adhesion, condition, and regulatory compliance. GVI is a non-intrusive visual examination to detect obvious damage, degradation, or discrepancies.

### 1.2 Inspection Intervals
- **Routine GVI**: Every 500 flight hours or 6 months, whichever occurs first
- **Class 1 Critical placards**: Every 300 flight hours or 3 months
- **Post-maintenance GVI**: After any maintenance involving placard removal or installation
- **Pre-flight GVI**: Spot check of safety-critical placards (emergency exits, fire equipment)

### 1.3 Applicability
This procedure applies to all placards and markings on AMPEL360 aircraft including:
- Interior placards (cabin, flight deck)
- Exterior placards (fuel, power, emergency exits)
- Permanent markings (painted, engraved, etched)
- Temporary placards (if present)
