## 1. Scope

### 1.1 Purpose
This document establishes the scope, governance structure, and effectivity criteria for all aircraft placards and markings documentation under ATA Chapter 11. It defines responsibilities, approval authorities, and applicability rules for placard and marking specifications, installation procedures, inspection requirements, and change control processes.

### 1.2 Applicability
This governance applies to all AMPEL360 Blended Wing Body (BWB) aircraft configurations, covering:
- Safety-critical placards (emergency exits, oxygen, fire suppression)
- Operational placards (weight and balance, fuel, hydraulic systems)
- Regulatory placards (certification, data plates, operating limitations)
- Informational markings (equipment identification, cable routing, zone markings)
- Temporary placards (maintenance, ferry permits, operational restrictions)
- Cabin interior placards (passenger safety instructions, equipment usage)
- Flight deck placards (flight controls, system panels, warning lights)
- Exterior markings (registration, nationality, safety zones)

### 1.3 Exclusions
The following are explicitly excluded from this chapter:
- Aircraft livery and external paint schemes (covered under ATA 51)
- Electronic displays and dynamic signage (covered under ATA 46 Information Systems)
- Structural identification markings applied during manufacturing (covered under ATA 51)
- Component data plates permanently attached by OEM (covered under component ATA chapters)

## 2. Governance Structure

3. **Human Factors Engineering** - Legibility and usability validation
4. **Materials & Processes** - Material specifications and qualification
5. **Safety Engineering** - Hazard analysis and risk assessment
6. **Quality Assurance** - Production release and audit compliance
7. **Regulatory Affairs** - Compliance verification (advisory member)

### 2.3 Approval Authority Matrix

| Change Type | Engineering Review | Airworthiness Approval | Quality Release |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| Safety-critical text or symbol change | Required | **Required** | Required |
| Translation of safety-critical content | Required | **Required** | Required |
| Material specification change | Required | **Required** | Required |

| Non-critical informational content | Required | Not Required | Required |
| Artwork revision (no content change) | Required | Not Required | Required |
| Temporary placard (>90 days service) | Required | **Required** | Required |

### 2.4 Safety Classification
Placards are classified by safety criticality:

**Class 1 - Critical Safety Items**
- Emergency exit identification and operation instructions
- Oxygen system operation and location
- Fire suppression equipment identification
- Emergency evacuation routes and procedures
- Hazardous cargo identification
- Flight control limitations and warnings
- All changes require Airworthiness approval and safety assessment

**Class 2 - Major Safety Items**
- Passenger safety briefing instructions
- Emergency equipment location (life vests, flashlights)
- Cabin crew operating procedures
- Equipment weight and balance placards
- Fuel and fluid system warnings
- Changes require engineering disposition and safety review

**Class 3 - Minor Safety Items**
- General operational information
- Equipment identification labels
- Maintenance access instructions
- Cable routing and identification
- Changes require engineering approval only

**Class 4 - Non-Safety Items**
- Decorative or branding elements
- General information labels
- Non-critical identification markings
- Changes require quality control verification only

## 3. Effectivity Management

### 3.1 Effectivity Rules
All placard specifications and installation records must include:
- **MSN (Manufacturer Serial Number)**: Specific aircraft or range (e.g., "001-050", "ALL")
- **Configuration**: Cabin layout variant (e.g., "BUSINESS", "ECONOMY", "CARGO")
- **Effective Date**: ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- **Modification Reference**: If placard is added/changed by mod (e.g., "MOD-11-001")
- **Supersession**: Reference to previous placard_id if replacing

### 3.2 Effectivity Recording
Effectivity must be recorded in three locations:
1. **INDEX.meta.yaml** - Chapter-level default effectivity
2. **Document sidecars** - File-level effectivity (.meta.yaml)
3. **Placard specifications** - Individual placard effectivity (JSON schema)

### 3.3 Effectivity Hierarchy
When effectivities conflict, the following precedence applies:
1. Individual placard specification (most specific)
2. Document sidecar effectivity
3. INDEX.meta.yaml default effectivity (least specific)

### 3.4 Retrofit and Modification Tracking
Retrofits and modifications affecting placards must:
- Create new placard_id with modification reference
- Document supersession chain (old_id â†’ new_id)
- Record incorporation status by aircraft MSN
- Maintain audit trail of all changes
