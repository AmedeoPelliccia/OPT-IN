### 2.2 Maximum Service Time Limits
| Location | Environment | Maximum Service Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| Cabin interior (non-critical) | Controlled environment | 90 days |
| Cabin interior (safety-critical) | Controlled environment | 30 days |
| Flight deck | Controlled environment | 30 days |
| Cargo compartment | Unpressurized | 60 days |
| Exterior (protected) | Weather exposure | 30 days |
| Exterior (exposed) | Weather exposure | 14 days |
| Ferry flight placards | Flight deck visible | Duration of ferry flight + 7 days |

### 2.3 Tracking and Documentation
- Log entry in aircraft logbook required for all temporary placards
- Include: placard ID, installation date, maximum removal date, reason, installer name
- Weekly tracking review by maintenance control
- Automatic alert at 75% of service time limit

## 3. Installation Procedure

### 3.1 Pre-Installation
1. Verify temporary placard is necessary and approved
2. Select appropriate material (adhesive vinyl for most applications, magnetic for ferrous surfaces)
3. Prepare placard text including:
   - "TEMPORARY" marking
   - Installation date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
   - Removal date: [YYYY-MM-DD] or flight hour limit
   - Reason: [Brief description]
   - Installed by: [Name]

### 3.2 Installation
1. Clean installation surface with IPA
2. Position temporary placard in visible location (but not obstructing safety-critical information)
3. Press firmly for adhesive vinyl (10-15 seconds)
4. Verify placard is secure and legible

### 3.3 Documentation
1. Make logbook entry: "Temporary placard installed at [location] for [reason]. Removal required by [date]. Installed by [name]."
2. Create tracking entry in maintenance system
3. Set reminder for removal or inspection before expiry

## 4. Removal Procedure

### 4.1 Removal Timing
- Remove temporary placard when:
  - Permanent placard is installed
  - Reason for temporary placard no longer exists
  - Maximum service time limit is reached (must not be exceeded)

### 4.2 Removal Steps
1. For adhesive vinyl: Peel slowly at low angle (15-30 degrees)
2. For magnetic: Lift gently
3. Remove all adhesive residue with IPA
4. Inspect surface for damage
5. Install permanent placard if required

### 4.3 Documentation
1. Make logbook entry: "Temporary placard removed from [location]. Permanent placard installed [if applicable]. Removed by [name]."
2. Close tracking entry in maintenance system

## 5. Inspection and Monitoring
- Inspect temporary placards during routine walk-around inspections
- Verify legibility and adhesion
- Check if service time limit is approaching
- If temporary placard shows deterioration before service limit, replace or remove

## 6. Emergency and Ferry Flight Placards

### 6.1 Ferry Flight Placards
- Must be installed in flight deck, clearly visible to flight crew
- Must state operational limitations or restrictions
- Required approval: Chief Pilot and Airworthiness authority
- Remove within 7 days after ferry flight completion

### 6.2 Emergency Temporary Placards
