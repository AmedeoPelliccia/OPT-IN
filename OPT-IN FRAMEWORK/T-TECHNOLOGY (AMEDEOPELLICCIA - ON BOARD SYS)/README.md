## Key Architectural Principles

1. **ATA Chapter Alignment**: Each subsystem follows ATA chapter standards with appropriate cross-references
2. **Modular Organization**: Systems are grouped by function to enable clear interfaces and dependencies
3. **Traceability**: All components maintain bidirectional traceability to requirements and certification evidence
4. **Integration Focus**: The I-INFORMATION_INTELLIGENCE_INTERFACES domain consolidates all integration points, APIs, and health monitoring
5. **Innovation Path**: The I2-I+D domain provides a structured approach for emerging technologies and AI enablement

Each subsystem directory contains detailed documentation, interface specifications, and technical data aligned with aerospace certification standards.
