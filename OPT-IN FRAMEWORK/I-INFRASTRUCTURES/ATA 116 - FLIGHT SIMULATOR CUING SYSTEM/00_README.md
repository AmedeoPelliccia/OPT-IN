# ATA 116 - FLIGHT SIMULATOR CUING SYSTEM

**Revision:** 2.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2029-01-01  
**Simulator ID:** FFS-001 (AMPEL360)

---

## Overview

This chapter contains the technical data, qualification tests, and maintenance procedures for all systems that provide sensory cues to the pilot, including visual, motion, aural, and control loading systems. The fidelity and performance of these systems are paramount for achieving high-level simulator qualification and preventing negative training.

**Governance & Fidelity Note:**
The systems defined in this chapter are the primary contributors to the simulator's immersion and fidelity. Their performance, especially **transport delay (latency)**, is rigorously tested against regulatory standards (e.g., EASA CS-FSTD(A)). All documentation must maintain explicit traceability to the qualification requirements in ATA 115 and the source aircraft data.

## AMPEL360 Specific Challenges

The AMPEL360 Blended Wing Body aircraft presents unique simulator cuing requirements:

### Visual System
Must accurately render the unique out-of-cockpit view of a Blended Wing Body, including:
- Wing flex and ground effect visuals
- Wide field-of-view for the integrated wing-body configuration
- Accurate representation of open-fan propulsor positions

### Aural System
Must model the complex soundscape of hybrid-electric propulsion:
- The transition from silent battery/fuel-cell taxi
- The distinct acoustic signature of the open-fan propulsors
- Multi-mode propulsion sound transitions

### Motion & Control Loading
Must replicate the handling qualities of:
- A large, tailless aircraft
- Advanced fly-by-wire controls
- Unique BWB control characteristics
