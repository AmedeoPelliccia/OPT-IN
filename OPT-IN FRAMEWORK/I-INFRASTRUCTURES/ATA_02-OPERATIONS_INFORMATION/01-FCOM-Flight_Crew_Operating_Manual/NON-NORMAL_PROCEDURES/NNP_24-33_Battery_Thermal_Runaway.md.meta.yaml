# Notes
notes: |
  This procedure addresses the unique characteristics of solid-CO₂ battery technology.
  Thermal runaway in solid-CO₂ batteries differs from Li-ion batteries - specific
  fire suppression and thermal management techniques apply.
  
  Critical: Immediate isolation prevents cascade to adjacent modules.
  Multiple battery modules provide redundancy - safe flight continuation possible.
