═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 1: OVERVIEW

Purpose: Define sensor requirements and monitoring procedures for hydrogen
refueling operations to ensure safe atmospheric conditions.

Hazards Monitored:
- Hydrogen concentration (flammability)
- Oxygen concentration (asphyxiation risk)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 2: SENSOR REQUIREMENTS

2.1 HYDROGEN SENSORS

Fixed Installation (Permanent):
- Location: Refueling pad perimeter (4 sensors minimum)
- Height: Ground level and 2 meters above ground
- Type: Catalytic bead or electrochemical
- Range: 0-100% LEL (Lower Explosive Limit)
- Alarm setpoints:
  * 10% LEL - Warning (amber)
  * 25% LEL - Danger (red) - STOP OPERATIONS
- Accuracy: ±2% LEL
- Response time: <10 seconds
- Calibration: Weekly
- Self-test: Daily before operations

Portable Sensors:
- Quantity: 2 minimum per refueling operation
- Location: Mobile, positioned by safety officer
- Specifications: Same as fixed sensors

2.2 OXYGEN SENSORS

Fixed Installation:
- Location: Refueling pad and enclosed areas
- Type: Electrochemical or paramagnetic
- Range: 0-25% O₂
- Alarm setpoints:
  * 19.5% O₂ - Low oxygen warning
  * 18% O₂ - Danger - EVACUATE
  * 23.5% O₂ - High oxygen warning (fire risk)
- Accuracy: ±0.5% O₂
- Response time: <15 seconds
- Calibration: Monthly

SECTION 3: SENSOR PLACEMENT

3.1 HYDROGEN SENSOR LOCATIONS

Primary Coverage (Fixed):
- Sensor H2-1: Aircraft refueling receptacle (1m radius)
- Sensor H2-2: Ground service equipment (GSE) connection point
- Sensor H2-3: Prevailing wind downwind position
- Sensor H2-4: Tank vent outlet area

Secondary Coverage (Portable):
- Mobile H2-A: Safety officer position (upwind)
- Mobile H2-B: Ground crew work area

3.2 OXYGEN SENSOR LOCATIONS

- Sensor O2-1: Refueling operator position
- Sensor O2-2: Any enclosed area adjacent to refueling zone
- Sensor O2-3: Below-grade areas (H₂ heavier than air when cold)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 4: MONITORING PROCEDURES

4.1 PRE-REFUELING CHECK
1. Verify all sensors online and reading normal
   - H₂: 0% LEL
   - O₂: 20.9% (ambient air)
2. Conduct sensor self-test (bump test)
3. Verify alarm functions (audible and visual)
4. Check data logging system active
5. Verify communication to control room

4.2 DURING REFUELING
- Continuous monitoring (no interruption)
- Safety officer assigned to monitor displays
- Readings logged every 60 seconds
- Immediate response to any alarm

4.3 POST-REFUELING
- Continue monitoring for 15 minutes after disconnect
- Verify atmospheric return to normal
- Download and archive sensor data
- Conduct equipment post-operation inspection

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 5: ALARM RESPONSE

5.1 HYDROGEN ALARM (25% LEL)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. STOP refueling operations - close valves
2. Activate emergency alarm
3. Evacuate non-essential personnel (25m radius)
4. Eliminate ignition sources
5. Increase ventilation (if enclosed area)
6. Alert fire brigade
7. Do NOT resume until:
   - Source identified and corrected
   - H₂ level <10% LEL for 10 minutes continuously
   - Safety supervisor authorizes

5.2 OXYGEN ALARM (LOW - <19.5%)

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Evacuate affected area
2. Do NOT enter until O₂ >19.5%
3. Investigate cause (H₂ displacement, inert gas leak)
4. Increase ventilation
5. Retest atmosphere before re-entry

5.3 SENSOR FAILURE ALARM

ACTIONS:
1. Deploy backup portable sensor immediately
2. Do NOT proceed with refueling if <4 H₂ sensors operative
3. Notify maintenance for sensor repair
4. Document failure and response

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 6: WEATHER IMPACT ON MONITORING

Wind Considerations:
- Wind speed: Optimal 5-15 knots (disperses H₂)
- Wind direction: Affects sensor placement (portable sensors)
- Calm conditions (<3 knots): Enhanced monitoring, H₂ may accumulate
- High wind (>35 knots): Refueling prohibited (operational limit)

Temperature/Precipitation:
- Cold conditions: Sensors may require warm-up time
- Rain/snow: Verify sensor weather protection
- Ice: Inspect sensors for icing (affects accuracy)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SECTION 7: CALIBRATION & MAINTENANCE

Weekly Calibration (H₂ Sensors):
- Zero calibration (clean air)
- Span calibration (50% LEL test gas)
- Verify alarm setpoints
- Document calibration data

Monthly Calibration (O₂ Sensors):
- Calibration with certified gas (20.9% O₂)
- Verify alarm setpoints
- Check sensor life indicator

Annual Service:
- Sensor replacement per manufacturer schedule
- System verification by qualified technician
- Complete system audit
