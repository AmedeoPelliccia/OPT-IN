## Overview

This chapter contains the technical data, qualification tests, and maintenance procedures for all systems that provide sensory cues to the pilot, including:

- **Visual System** - Image generator, projectors, display system
- **Motion System** - 6-DOF motion platform, washout algorithms
- **Aural System** - Sound system, acoustic models (hybrid-electric propulsion)
- **Control Loading System** - Flight control force feedback

The fidelity and performance of these systems are paramount for achieving high-level simulator qualification (EASA Level D) and preventing negative training.
