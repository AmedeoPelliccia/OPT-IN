**ATA Chapter**: 10  
**Subsection**: 01 - PARKING AND MANEUVERING

## 1. Purpose

This procedure defines gate positioning requirements specific to the AMPEL360 Blended Wing Body (BWB) configuration.

## 2. Scope

Applies to all gate parking operations where passenger boarding bridges will be connected to AMPEL360 BWB aircraft.

## 3. BWB Configuration Challenges

The BWB design presents unique considerations:
- Wider fuselage profile than conventional aircraft
- Multiple passenger door locations along body
- Limited cockpit visibility for lateral edges
- Non-standard boarding bridge interface points

## 4. Prerequisites

- Gate equipped with BWB-compatible boarding bridge(s)
- Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS) calibrated for BWB
- Ground crew trained on BWB gate operations
- Weather conditions suitable for safe maneuvering

## 5. Safety Precautions

- ⚠️ Enhanced ground crew communication due to cockpit visibility limitations
- ⚠️ Verify all personnel clear of body edges during final approach
- ⚠️ Monitor for boarding bridge clearance throughout positioning
- ⚠️ Stop immediately if any uncertainty regarding clearances

## 6. Equipment Required

- VDGS system (BWB profile programmed)
- Marshaller with BWB-specific wands/signals
- Minimum 2 wing walkers for edge monitoring
- UHF/VHF radio communication
- Stop wands (emergency use)

## 7. Procedure

### 7.1 Pre-Approach Briefing

1. **Crew Coordination**
   - Confirm marshaller and wing walkers in position
   - Test radio communication
   - Review gate-specific constraints
   - Identify boarding door positions (typically doors 1L, 2L, 3L for BWB)

2. **VDGS Verification**
   - Verify VDGS displaying BWB profile
   - Confirm aircraft type code correct
   - Check azimuth guidance active

### 7.2 Gate Approach

1. **Initial Approach (50m to gate)**
   - Follow marshaller primary signals
   - Cross-check VDGS azimuth guidance
   - Maintain taxi speed < 3 knots
   - Wing walkers monitor edges continuously

2. **Final Approach (50m to stop point)**
   - Precise speed control (< 2 knots)
   - Announce distance remaining at 30m, 20m, 10m
   - Wing walkers signal "CLEAR LEFT" / "CLEAR RIGHT"
   - Monitor VDGS stop indicator

3. **Stop Position**
   - Stop on VDGS "STOP" signal
   - Apply parking brake
   - Confirm nose gear on centerline (±0.3m tolerance)
   - Verify door alignment with boarding bridge(s)

### 7.3 Boarding Bridge Alignment Verification

1. **Visual Checks**
   - Door 1L aligned with bridge 1 (±0.5m lateral, ±0.3m vertical)
   - Door 2L aligned with bridge 2 (if dual bridge gate)
   - Verify no structural interference

2. **Final Position Documentation**
   - Record final position coordinates
   - Note any alignment deviations
   - Document boarding bridge connection times

### 7.4 Parking Completion

1. Set parking brake and announce "PARKED"
2. Install wheel chocks
3. Connect ground power
4. Await boarding bridge connection confirmation

## 8. BWB-Specific Gate Dimensions

| Parameter | Standard Value | BWB Value |
|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Centerline to door 1L | 5.0 m | 8.5 m |
| Centerline to door 2L | 12.0 m | 16.0 m |
| Total body width | 12.0 m | 25.0 m |
| Stop position tolerance | ±0.5 m | ±0.3 m |
| Bridge offset angle | 90° | 95° (adjusted) |

## 9. Emergency Stop Criteria

Immediate stop if:
- Wing walker gives stop signal
- VDGS shows red "STOP" before stop point
- Any personnel enter clearance zone
- Uncertainty regarding clearances
- Bridge contact detected

## 10. Abnormal Conditions

### Misalignment > 0.5m

1. Notify ground crew
2. Request tug repositioning (do not attempt taxi correction)
3. Re-verify VDGS calibration
4. Document incident

### VDGS Failure

1. Revert to marshaller guidance only
2. Reduce approach speed to < 1 knot
3. Use additional wing walkers
4. Consider rejecting gate (use alternate if available)

## 11. Completion Criteria

- ✅ Aircraft within stop position tolerance
- ✅ All doors aligned with boarding bridges
- ✅ No structural interference
- ✅ Parking brake set and chocks installed
- ✅ Ground crew confirms "PARKED AND SECURE"
