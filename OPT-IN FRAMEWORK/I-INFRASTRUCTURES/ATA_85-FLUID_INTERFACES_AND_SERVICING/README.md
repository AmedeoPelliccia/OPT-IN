# ATA 85: Fluid Interfaces and Servicing

This chapter defines the standards for cryogenic fluid interfaces and servicing of the AMPEL360 aircraft, ensuring safety, interoperability, and efficiency in fueling operations.

## Governance
* **Standard Lifecycle:** Each standard document (`-STD`) has a lifecycle state (`DRAFT`, `CANDIDATE`, `RATIFIED`, `DEPRECATED`) defined in its metadata.
* **Verifiable Compliance:** Each interface standard (ICD, PROTOCOL, SPEC) is directly linked to a compliance test procedure (`TEST_STD-89-xxx`).
* **Security by Design:** Critical fluid interfaces include specific security requirements and validation procedures.

## Contents

### 01-CRYOGENIC_HYDROGEN_LH2
