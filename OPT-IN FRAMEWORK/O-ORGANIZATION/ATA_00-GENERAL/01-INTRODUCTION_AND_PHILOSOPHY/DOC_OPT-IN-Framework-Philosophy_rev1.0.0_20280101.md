## 1.0 Purpose

This document outlines the core principles of the OPT-IN (Organization, Program, Technology, Infrastructure, Neural Networks) framework as applied to the AMPEL360 program.

The OPT-IN methodology is a structured framework for development and documentation that ensures consistency, traceability, and auditability across all aerospace systems projects.

---

## 2.0 Core Principles

### 2.1 Digital First

All technical data is created and managed in a machine-readable, version-controlled format (Markdown, YAML, JSON, XML). PDFs are considered build artifacts, not the source of truth.

**Rationale:**
- Enables automated validation and compliance checking
- Supports continuous integration and deployment workflows
- Facilitates version control and change tracking
- Ensures reproducibility and audit readiness

### 2.2 Structured & Auditable

The directory structure is a formal data model. Compliance with naming, numbering, and metadata conventions is enforced automatically through CI/CD pipelines.

**Key Requirements:**
- Every artifact follows the standardized naming convention
- Each document has an accompanying `.meta.yaml` sidecar
- Directory structure mirrors ATA chapter taxonomy
- All cross-references are explicitly declared and validated

### 2.3 Explicit Interfaces

All dependencies between systems (physical, data, or procedural) are explicitly documented and cross-referenced.

**Interface Types:**
- **Physical:** Mechanical connections, fluid lines, electrical harnesses
- **Data:** Communication protocols, message formats, data flows
- **Procedural:** Operating procedures, maintenance workflows, training requirements

### 2.4 Lifecycle Traceability

The framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with the ATA 95 Digital Product Passport, providing a complete, verifiable history of the aircraft and its documentation.

**Traceability Chain:**
- Requirements → Design → Implementation → Verification → Operation
- Each artifact is traceable to its source requirement
- Changes are tracked through semantic versioning
- Effectivity and applicability are explicitly defined

## 3.0 The OPT-IN Taxonomy

The OPT-IN framework organizes all technical information into five primary branches:

### 3.1 O - ORGANIZATION

Governance, compliance, airworthiness, and maintenance policies.

**ATA Chapters:**
- ATA 00: General
- ATA 01: Maintenance Policy
- ATA 04: Airworthiness Limitations
- ATA 05: Time Limits / Maintenance Checks
- ATA 18: Vibration and Noise Analysis

### 3.2 P - PROGRAM

Aircraft-level configuration control, servicing, and dimensional data.

**ATA Chapters:**
- ATA 06: Dimensions and Areas
- ATA 07: Lifting and Shoring
- ATA 08: Leveling and Weighing
- ATA 09: Towing and Taxiing
- ATA 12: Servicing

### 3.3 T - TECHNOLOGY

The on-board systems tree that maps airframe, propulsion, energy, OS, and avionics to ATA codes.

**Mnemonic Taxonomy: A-M-E-D-E-O-P-E-L-L-I-C-C-I-A**
- **A**irframe (ATA 20, 50-57)
- **M**echanics (ATA 27, 29, 32, 37, 41)
- **E**nvironment (ATA 21, 26, 30, 36, 38)
- **D**ata (ATA 31)
- **E**nergy (ATA 24, 28)
- **O**perating Systems (ATA 42, 44, 45, 46, 49)
- **P**ropulsion (ATA 71-80)
- **E**quipment (ATA 25, 33, 34, 35)
- **L**ighting (ATA 33)
- **L**ife Support (ATA 35)
- **I**nterior (ATA 25)
- **C**ommunications (ATA 23)
- **C**ontrol (ATA 22, 27)
- **I**nstruments (ATA 31)
- **A**vionics (ATA 31-34)

### 3.4 I - INFRASTRUCTURE

Ground, airport, and supply-chain assets; flight simulators.

**ATA Chapters:**
- ATA 02: Operations Information
- ATA 03: Support Information
- ATA 10: Parking, Mooring, Storage
- ATA 13: Tools
- ATA 115: Flight Simulator Systems
- ATA 116: Flight Simulator Cueing

### 3.5 N - NEURAL NETWORKS

Data lineage, user traceability, and AI/ML models for digital passporting.

**ATA Chapters:**
- ATA 95: Digital Product Passport

## 4.0 Methodological Principles

### 4.1 ATA-Anchored Documentation

Every technical artifact—requirement, code module, subsystem—is indexed by ATA chapter.section.subject to ensure interoperability with iSpec 2200 and S1000D deliverables.

**Naming Convention:**
```
<TYPE>_<Subject>_rev<MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH>_<YYYYMMDD>.<ext>
```

**Examples:**
- `DOC_Fuel-Cell-Architecture_rev2.1.0_20280315.md`
- `ICD_LH2-Coupling_rev3.0.0_20280901.md`
- `POLICY_System-Safety-Program-Plan_rev1.0.0_20280301.md`

### 4.2 Cross-Referenced Traceability

Logical, thermal, and energy interfaces are documented through secondary ATA references inside each branch.

**Example:**
- Primary: ATA 28 (Fuel System)
- Secondary: ATA 73 (Engine Fuel System), ATA 49 (Auxiliary Power Unit)

### 4.3 Reduction of Provisional Subjects

New technologies (e.g., quantum scheduling, CO₂ batteries) are introduced under provisional codes until validated by standards review.

**Provisional Naming:**
```
ATA-XX-YY-ZZ_<Technology>_PROV
```

### 4.4 Bidirectional Linking

Development repositories and technical manuals share identifiers so that commits, verification steps, and documentation updates remain synchronized.

**Traceability Matrix:**
```yaml
requirement_id: REQ-FCS-001
design_artifact: DES_Flight-Control-System_rev2.0.0_20280201.md
verification_method: ATP_FCS-Functional-Test_rev1.0.0_20280301.md
```

### 4.5 Audit Readiness

Every addition must be traceable to a requirement and classification entry, guaranteeing certification evidence continuity.

**Audit Trail Requirements:**
- All changes tracked in version control
- Peer review mandatory for all changes
- CI validation required before merge
- Metadata checksums verified automatically

## 5.0 Implementation Guidelines

### 5.1 Document Creation

1. Identify the appropriate ATA chapter and subdirectory
2. Use the standardized naming convention
3. Create the document in Markdown format
4. Generate the `.meta.yaml` sidecar with required metadata
5. Calculate and record the SHA-256 checksum

### 5.2 Document Review

1. Submit changes via pull request
2. Ensure at least one peer review from designated owners
3. Verify CI validation passes
4. Update effectivity and applicability as needed
5. Merge to main branch

### 5.3 Document Maintenance

1. Use semantic versioning for all revisions
2. Update `.meta.yaml` metadata for each revision
3. Maintain revision history in document and metadata
4. Archive superseded versions per retention policy
5. Update cross-references as needed

## 6.0 Benefits and Outcomes

The OPT-IN framework yields a **single-source-of-truth architecture** where:

- **Engineering Design** remains coherent with certification data
- **Maintenance Documentation** stays synchronized with as-built configuration
- **Training Materials** reflect current operational procedures
- **Regulatory Submissions** are generated from validated sources
- **Digital Product Passport** provides complete lifecycle traceability

This framework ensures that all stakeholders—engineers, operators, maintainers, and regulators—work from the same authoritative information, reducing errors and improving safety.
