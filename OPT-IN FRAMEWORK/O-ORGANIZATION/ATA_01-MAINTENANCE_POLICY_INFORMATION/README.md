# ATA 01 - MAINTENANCE POLICY INFORMATION

## Description

This chapter defines the foundational policies, philosophies, and programs that govern the entire maintenance lifecycle of the AMPEL360. It establishes the "why" and "when" of maintenance, serving as the master reference for the detailed "how-to" procedures found in other ATA chapters.

**Governance & Purpose:**
- **Regulatory Compliance:** This chapter is the primary location for the Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR) and the Maintenance Planning Document (MPD), which are the basis for the operator's approved maintenance program.
- **Strategic Foundation:** It outlines the core maintenance philosophies, such as the reliance on On-Condition maintenance, Condition-Monitoring, and data-driven prognostics (tying into ATA 92 and 95).
- **Programmatic Control:** It defines the processes for managing maintenance program variations, escalations, and revisions.
