- **Aircraft Condition:** Aircraft powered by ground power, battery system isolated.

### 4.0 Success Criteria
- The Battery Service Tool completes the capacity check cycle.
- The reported State of Health (SOH) for all modules is greater than 85%.
- If SOH is less than 85%, refer to the Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) `24-33-00` for corrective action.

### 5.0 Source & Justification
- **Source:** Maintenance Review Board Report (MRBR), Section 5.4.
- **Justification:** To detect battery degradation before it impacts operational performance or safety, preventing potential thermal events or loss of power.
