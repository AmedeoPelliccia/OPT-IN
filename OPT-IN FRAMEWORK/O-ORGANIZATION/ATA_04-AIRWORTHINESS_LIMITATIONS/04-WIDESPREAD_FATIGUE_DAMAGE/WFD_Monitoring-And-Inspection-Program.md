**Document Type:** Widespread Fatigue Damage Prevention Program  
**Revision:** 1.0.0  
**Effective Date:** 2028-04-01  
**Supersedes:** None

---

## 1.0 Scope

This document defines the Widespread Fatigue Damage (WFD) monitoring and inspection program for the AMPEL360 aircraft. The program is designed to prevent the occurrence of WFD in the aircraft structure throughout its operational life.

## 2.0 Applicability

- **Aircraft Type:** AMPEL360-BWB-H2
- **Manufacturer Serial Numbers:** ALL
- **Structure:** Primary airframe structure susceptible to fatigue

## 3.0 Regulatory Basis

This program is established in accordance with:
- **CS 25.571(a)(5)** - Widespread Fatigue Damage (WFD)
- **FAA AC 120-104** - Establishing and Implementing Limit of Validity
- **EASA AMC 25.571** - Damage Tolerance and Fatigue Evaluation
- **FAA FAR 26.21** - Extended Limit of Validity of the Engineering Data

## 4.0 Definitions

### 4.1 Widespread Fatigue Damage (WFD)

**WFD** is the simultaneous presence of cracks at multiple structural locations that are of sufficient size and density such that the structure will no longer meet its damage tolerance requirements.

### 4.2 Limit of Validity (LOV)

**LOV** is the period during which it has been demonstrated that widespread fatigue damage will not occur in the aircraft structure. The LOV defines the operational limit of the aircraft based on engineering data.

## 5.0 Limit of Validity (LOV)

### 5.1 AMPEL360 LOV

**The Limit of Validity for the AMPEL360 aircraft is 50,000 Flight Cycles (FC).**

- **Basis:** Flight Cycles (FC)
- **Justification:** Full-scale fatigue testing and analysis per STR-RPT-50-001
- **Approval:** EASA and FAA certified LOV on 2028-03-15

### 5.2 LOV Restrictions

**Aircraft MUST NOT be operated beyond the LOV without:**
1. Extension of LOV through additional substantiation
2. Formal approval by EASA and FAA
3. Implementation of enhanced WFD inspection program

## 6.0 Program Activation Criteria

### 6.1 Initial Activation

The WFD inspection program is activated for each aircraft upon reaching the **Limit of Validity (LOV)** of 50,000 Flight Cycles.

### 6.2 Pre-LOV Monitoring

Prior to LOV, the following monitoring activities are required:

| Flight Cycles | Activity | Reference |
|:--------------|:---------|:----------|
| **30,000 FC** | Baseline WFD structural survey on lead aircraft | AMM 51-00-00-900-001 |
| **40,000 FC** | Enhanced structural inspection on 10% of fleet | AMM 51-00-00-900-002 |
| **45,000 FC** | Pre-LOV comprehensive inspection on lead aircraft | AMM 51-00-00-900-003 |

## 7.0 Lead-the-Fleet Aircraft

### 7.1 Selection Criteria

**Lead-the-fleet aircraft** are selected based on:
- Highest flight cycle accumulation
- Representative operational usage
- Complete maintenance records
- DPP data integrity

### 7.2 Lead Aircraft Sampling Plan

Upon activation of the WFD program (at LOV), an inspection of **one lead-the-fleet aircraft** is required:

- **Inspection Scope:** 100% of PSEs (Principal Structural Elements)
- **Inspection Method:** Per AMM 51-00-00-900-004 "WFD Initial Survey"
- **Timeline:** Within 500 FC of reaching LOV

### 7.3 Subsequent Sampling

The subsequent sampling plan will be based on the findings from the lead aircraft, as per report **STR-RPT-50-001** "WFD Analysis and Sampling Methodology."

**If no WFD is found:**
- Continue monitoring lead aircraft at 2,000 FC intervals
- Inspect additional fleet aircraft at 5,000 FC intervals

**If WFD precursors are found:**
- Activate accelerated inspection program
- Inspect 25% of fleet immediately
- Implement corrective actions per engineering disposition

Secondary structure not designated as PSE is subject to existing damage tolerance inspection requirements per ATA 04-02 (Damage Tolerance Structural Inspections).

## 9.0 Inspection Procedures

### 9.1 WFD Inspection Methodology

All WFD inspections must:
1. Use validated non-destructive testing (NDT) methods
2. Achieve minimum Probability of Detection (PoD) per MIL-HDBK-1823A
3. Be performed by qualified Level II or Level III NDT technicians
4. Be documented in aircraft maintenance log and DPP system

### 9.2 NDT Method Requirements

| Method | Minimum PoD | Crack Size | Confidence |
|:-------|:------------|:-----------|:-----------|
| HFEC | 90% | 1.0 mm | 95% |
