- **Wing Fuel:** Defuel outboard wing tanks (tanks 2L and 2R)
- **Environmental Control:** Maintain inspection area at 15-30°C
- **Lighting:** Minimum 1000 lux for visual inspection

## 5.0 Inspection Technique

### 5.1 Primary Method: Detailed Visual Inspection (DVI)

- **Procedure:** AMM 57-50-00-600-001
- **Magnification:** 10X minimum for critical areas
- **Cleaning:** All surfaces must be cleaned per AMM 20-10-10 before inspection
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - No cracks, corrosion, or deformation
  - No fastener looseness or rotation
  - No fretting or wear marks

### 5.2 Secondary Method: Ultrasonic Inspection (UT)

**Applied to:**
- Spar cap sections (cannot be visually inspected)
- Areas beneath doubler plates
- Bonded joint interfaces

**Requirements:**
- **Method:** Pulse-echo ultrasonic inspection
- **Frequency:** 5 MHz for aluminum structure
- **Procedure:** AMM 57-50-00-600-002
- **Equipment:** Calibrated UT instrument per AMM 57-50-00-600-003
- **Reference Standards:** STD-UT-57-01 (contains 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 mm flat-bottom holes)

### 5.3 Probability of Detection (PoD)

The combined DVI + UT inspection must achieve:
- **PoD:** ≥ 95% for a 1.5 mm (0.06 in) crack or delamination
- **Confidence Level:** 95%
- **Validation:** Per MIL-HDBK-1823A

## 6.0 Inspection Results and Actions

### 6.1 No Defects Found

- Record inspection completion in aircraft maintenance log
- Update DPP system with inspection results
- Next inspection due: Current FC + 12,000 FC

### 6.2 Cracks, Corrosion, or Defects Found

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. **Ground Aircraft:** Do not return to service until repaired
2. **Notify Authorities:** Report to Type Certificate Holder and airworthiness authority within 24 hours
3. **Engineering Disposition:** Required before any corrective action
4. **Repair or Replace:** Per approved SRM or Engineering Order
5. **DPP Documentation:** Full defect and repair documentation

### 6.3 Repeat Inspection After Repair

- **Initial:** 3,000 FC after repair
- **Subsequent:** 6,000 FC intervals
- **Thereafter:** Return to normal 12,000 FC interval after two successful inspections (subject to engineering approval)

## 7.0 Special Inspection Zones

### 7.1 High-Load Transfer Points

The following fastener locations are subject to enhanced inspection:
- **Fasteners 1-3 and Last 3:** In each row of wing joint
- **Inspection:** 5X magnification minimum
- **Accept/Reject:** Zero tolerance for any crack indications

### 7.2 Environmental Damage Inspection

Inspect for:
- **Corrosion:** Especially in lap joints and faying surfaces
- **Moisture ingress:** Evidence of water in structure
- **Lightning strike damage:** If aircraft has experienced lightning event
