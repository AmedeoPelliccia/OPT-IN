- **Inspection Zone:** Fuselage Station 400-600, Butt Line ±50 to ±200

## 3.0 Limitation

### 3.1 Inspection Interval

**A High Frequency Eddy Current (HFEC) inspection of the BWB wing root area MUST be performed every 8,000 flight cycles.**

- **Basis:** Flight Cycles (FC)
- **Interval:** 8,000 FC
- **Tolerance:** +0 / -0 (Zero tolerance)
- **Initial Inspection:** 8,000 FC from date of manufacture

### 3.2 No Deferral Permitted

This inspection **CANNOT** be deferred or extended without formal approval from the certifying authority with substantiating data demonstrating continued airworthiness.

## 4.0 Inspection Requirements

### 4.1 Inspection Areas

The inspection must cover **100% of the following critical areas:**

1. **Wing-to-Body Joint Fastener Holes:**
   - All fastener holes in Wing Station (WS) 0 to WS 50
   - Critical fatigue initiation sites

2. **Wing Root Spars:**
   - Forward spar cap, web, and lower cap
   - Aft spar cap, web, and lower cap
   - Spar-to-skin attachment points

3. **Skin Splice Joints:**
   - Upper and lower skin splices at BWB transition
   - Longitudinal and circumferential splice joints

4. **Load Transfer Fittings:**
   - Primary load transfer fittings (6 locations per side)
   - Attachment bolt holes and bearing surfaces

**Inspection Drawings:**
- INSP-DWG-53-10-01 (Rev. B)
- INSP-DWG-53-10-02 (Rev. B)

### 4.2 Access Requirements

- **Access Panels:** Remove panels 530L, 530R, 531L, 531R per [AMM 53-10-00-400-001](../../../T-TECHNOLOGY%20(AMEDEOPELLICCIA%20-%20ON%20BOARD%20SYS)/A-AIRFRAME/53_FUSELAGE/AMM/53-10-00-400-001.md)
- **Environmental Control:** Inspection area must be maintained at 15-30°C, <70% RH
- **Lighting:** Minimum 1000 lux at inspection surface

## 5.0 Inspection Technique

### 5.1 Method

- **Primary Method:** High Frequency Eddy Current (HFEC) Inspection
- **Frequency:** 500 kHz to 2 MHz (depending on material thickness)
- **Equipment:** Calibrated HFEC instrument per [AMM 53-10-00-600-001](../../../T-TECHNOLOGY%20(AMEDEOPELLICCIA%20-%20ON%20BOARD%20SYS)/A-AIRFRAME/53_FUSELAGE/AMM/53-10-00-600-001.md)
- **Procedure:** Follow [AMM 53-10-00-600-002](../../../T-TECHNOLOGY%20(AMEDEOPELLICCIA%20-%20ON%20BOARD%20SYS)/A-AIRFRAME/53_FUSELAGE/AMM/53-10-00-600-002.md)

### 5.2 Probability of Detection (PoD)

The HFEC technique employed must achieve:
- **PoD:** ≥ 90% for a 1.25 mm (0.05 in) crack
- **Confidence Level:** 95%
- **Validation:** Per DOT/FAA/AR-05/15 guidelines

### 5.3 Calibration

- HFEC equipment must be calibrated before each inspection using reference standards
- Reference standards: STD-HFEC-53-01 (contains 0.5, 1.0, 1.25, and 2.0 mm EDM notches)
- Calibration validity: 24 hours or end of work shift, whichever comes first

## 6.0 Inspection Results and Actions

### 6.1 No Cracks Found

- Record inspection completion in aircraft maintenance log
- Update DPP system with inspection status
- Next inspection due: Current FC + 8,000 FC

### 6.2 Cracks or Indications Found

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. **Ground Aircraft:** Do not return to service
2. **Notify Type Certificate Holder:** Within 24 hours
3. **Engineering Evaluation:** Required before flight
4. **Repair:** Per approved Structural Repair Manual (SRM) or Engineering Order (EO)
5. **DPP Update:** Log finding, evaluation, and repair actions

### 6.3 Repeat Inspection After Repair

- **Initial:** 2,000 FC after repair
- **Subsequent:** 4,000 FC intervals until reaching 8,000 FC post-repair
- **Thereafter:** Return to normal 8,000 FC interval if approved by engineering

## 7.0 Certification Basis

This inspection requirement is established in accordance with:
- **CS 25.571** - Damage-tolerance and fatigue evaluation of structure
- **FAA AC 25.571-1D** - Damage Tolerance and Fatigue Evaluation of Structure
- **Source Report:** STR-RPT-53-010 "BWB Wing Root Damage Tolerance Analysis"
