# Placeholder for RUL Model - Landing Gear v1.2
# This file represents a trained machine learning model (pickle format)
# In production, this would contain the serialized model data
#
# Model Details:
# - Version: 1.2
# - Algorithm: Random Forest Regressor
# - Training Date: 2028-11-15
# - Features: flight_cycles, landing_load_max, brake_temp_avg, hydraulic_pressure_variance
# - Target: Remaining Useful Life (in cycles)
# - Performance: MAE = 45 cycles, RÂ² = 0.87
#
# For demonstration purposes, this is a text placeholder.
# Actual .pkl files would be binary serialized Python objects.
